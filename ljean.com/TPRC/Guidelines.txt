All abstracts must be submitted via the online submission form, should not exceed 500 words, and should be accompanied by contact information and a 200-word biographical note for each author.  Submission of an abstract entails a commitment of at least one author attend the conference to present the work. To participate in the student paper competition, students must submit an entire paper and a note from the primary advisor to indicate that it is the students work. Those student papers that do not win the competition will be considered for the abstract competition.  Students are encouraged to submit full papers and should consult the guidelines and deadlines for the Student Paper Competition.If the option is selected by the author at the time of submission, student abstracts that are not accepted will be considered for the poster session. This applies only to papers where students are the first or sole author.  Requesting consideration in the poster session entails a commitment that the student will attend the conference. 

************************Poster Guidelines************************Posters submissions will be reviewed based on the content and the presentation of the provided materials. Therefore, the posters submission should include a description of the idea that is the core of the work, supporting video or imagery, and a discussion of the implication of the demonstration or of future work. Literature searches in particular are not required for posters which are intended to serve primarily as demonstrations.  Posters will be characterized into themes and methods, in order to ensure the most appropriate and informed review. We are accepting two types of poster presentation. Regardless of the type, all poster submissions should include an abstract submission suitable for inclusion on the TPRC web site. First, the a poster can consist of a set of slides that will be arranged in order. These can be in GIF, JPEG or PDF. They can be classic presentation slides, images, screenshots, or any other static content that can be printed and presented on foam board. Powerpoint submissions will not be reviewed.  Second, the poster can consist of a video. Videos must be in MPEG to be reviewed. The video should be ten minutes or less, and be suitable for an environment with variable lighting and background noise.  Presenters will be required to provide their own displays for video posters.
