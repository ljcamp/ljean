<br>
<br>
<A href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/deckard">Gary Deckard</a> has bridged two divides: military and academic, computer
   science and education. With extensive experience in operations and training,
  his dissertation examined the factors that lead to individual and collective success in a series of exercises and in classroom
   practice. His interests are security, privacy, cybersecurity pedagogy, and
security for Cyber Physical Systems.
    <br>
    <br>

<br>
<br>
<A  href="http://pmoriano.com/">Pablo Moriano</a> develops innovative models and methods for large-scale networks that can help in the understanding of the dynamical evolution of empirical network data. A direct application of this approach is in the field of anomaly detection in routing data. These research efforts are multi-disciplinary and encompass contributions from computer science, statistics, and physics.
<br>
<br>
<A href="http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/ktbenton/">Kevin Benton</a> is
    focused on the dynamics of network security in both SDN and BGP.  In the past, in his
    internships at the Cambrigde University Computer Security
    Laboratory and now at BigNetworks, his focus was on SDN. His work
reminds us that engineers are humans too.
<br>
<br>
    <a href="http://www.zhdong.net/">Zheng Dong</a> is a pioneer in using machine learning in the service of computer security. His dissertation applied machine learning to the detection of phishing sites (using certificate analysis), rogues certificates, and banking certificates.   He finished his masters thesis in spring 2010 on the topic of the marginal return for adding an individual into a social network for the purposes of recommendations or discovery. He works at Microsoft Seattle. 
   <br>
<br>
 Post doctoral fellow   <A
    href="http://www.prashanthrajivan.com/home.html"> Prashanth
    Rajivan</a> has moved to Carnegie Mellon. He is focused on the
    psychology of security not only of individuals, but also as a
    function of group processes. 
    <br>
    <br>
<A href="http://t34k3ttl3.wordpress.com/">Tim Kelley</a> combines
    human experimentation with large scale modeling. His implements
    complex systems models that integrate human behaviors as critical
    variables. He is currently employed in a joint position at Indiana
University Department of Psychology and Crane Naval, continuing to
    combine brain science with network science. 
<br>
    <br>
   <A href="http://www.vaibhav.net">Vaibhav Garg</a> on ecrime, risk communication, and usable security. His work brought perceived risk methods to the study of on-line risk, as well as pioneering applications of crime science from criminal justice to online crime. He is Director of Security Awareness at VISA. <br>
    <br>
   <A href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/debinliu">Debin Liu</a> on risk-based access control and usable security. His work included a mastery of quantitative tools combined with economic theories of security; such as applying contract theory to access control. After his time as a senior researcher at PayPal, he returned to China to built a first Chinese business credit rating agency.<br>
    <br>
   <A href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/camilo-viecco/2/17a/404">Camilo Veicco</a> on Tor. His redesign of TCP in Tor reduced delay, jitter, and prevented timing attacks. He is a senior scientist at Mozilla.<br>
    <br>
<A href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/alex-tsow/2/184/8a2">Alex Tsow</a> on making programming easier, usable security.

    <br>
<a href="http://allan.friedmans.org/">Allan Friedman</a> on security and privacy. By combining game theory and social network modeling he was able to examine how information flowed across the combination of social and computing networks. His work pioneered the use of crowd-sourcing and peer production for diffusion of information sharing for community security and privacy (beyond open source communities). He is the Director of Cybersecurity Initiatives at National Telecommunications and Information Administration in the US Department of Commerce.  <br>
