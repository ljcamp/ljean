<h1>I525: Economics of Information Security</h1>
<center><em>
Readings and schedule for Economics of Information Security for Fall 2008.<br><br>
Professor <a href=http://www.ljean.com/">Jean Camp</a> <br><br>
</em>
<br><div class="noteBox">Sept. 3   The Course in a Nutshell</div>
<h4>Introduction and course overview</h4>
<br>In the initial class meeting I ask that you write down what particularly interest you in the topic. Are you more interested in the methods or the findings? Is your heart in HCI or are you the soul of business? What level of mathematical discussion is appropriate for the course? The course will be designed to serve the needs of the students in it.
<h4>Reading</h4>
<br>Questionnaire: Learning Economics of Security - provided in class
<br>
<div class="noteBox">Sept. 8  Why Economics of Security? </div>
<h4>Reading</h4>
<br>Ross Anderson and Tyler Moore. "The Economics of Information Security" Science 314 (5799), pp.610-613,
October 27, 2006. Sixth Workshop on Economics of Information Security, Pittsburgh PA, 7-8 June 2008. <A href=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~twm29/science-econ.pdf>http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~twm29/science-econ.pdf</a>

<br><div class="noteBox">Sept 10     Security as Economics</div>
<br>Here we move towards a more formal explanation that integrates security and economics. The security market is one with obtuse claims, and diffuse contractual requirements. When <h4>Reading</h4> this paper, come up with your own reasoned definition of security. In class we will examine some of the white papers and materials from security providers, and view them through the lens of these works.
<h4>Reading</h4>

<div class="noteBox">Sept 15 What is a Network? </div>
<br>Those in this class might consider the network to be The Internet. However, studies of interactions, pricing and connectivity are as ancient as the sea trade of the Roman Empire, where the concept of common carriage was first applied. 
<h4>Questions to consider during  Reading</h4>
<br>Why the commonality of the use of the word networks? How is it that buying a chocolate bar is not entirely unlike buying a router? How are these things different? What about buying software for a router?
<h4>Reading</h4>
<br>The Economics of Networks, provided in class Sept 10. 
<br><div class="noteBox">Sept 17 Following the Money</div>
<br>The reason that there is economics of security is because there are violations of security based on economics, e.g. crime. These papers address the economics of crime, the incentives and the nature of the proverbial beast.
<h4>Questions to consider during  Reading</h4>
<br>Are these numbers what you expect? Credit card number prices appear to be going down. Think about two opposite reasons why this might be the case. 
<h4>Reading</h4>

<br><div class="noteBox">Sept 22 Risky Business</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during  Reading</h4>
<br>Security as risk management is a distinction approach. The question above approach this but these more formal guidelines offer more insight.
<h4>Reading</h4>

<br>Chapter 10, "Risk Budget Theory"
<br><div class="noteBox">Sept 24 We Spent {Too Much, Not Enough} on Security</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during  Reading</h4>
<br>These two papers take the same fundamental question and come up with two different answers. How can that be the case? As with all the papers we read this semester the critical issues are in the first few pages: the assumptions and the construction of the model.
<h4>Reading</h4>

<br><div class="noteBox">Sept 29     Experimentation In Practice </div>
<h4>Questions to consider during  Reading</h4>
<br>How do you apply issues of risk budgets to computer security? How can you construct an experiment that takes an abstract highly empirical concept and turn it into an applied question? How does this work build upon the risk budget work we discussed previously?

<div class="noteBox">Oct   6   Evaluation of Theory from Direct Market Observation</div>

<br>Assignment
<br>What value surveillance? 
<br>You will see many cameras and experience many "security"measures as you travel. Do these make economic sense? Do these make practical sense? Please count the number of cameras you see in a day, particularly a travel day, and also note the number and contexts in which you have to present ID. And then construct an argument identifying the most and least economically rational.
