<h2>The Course in a Nutshell</h2> 
<div class="noteBox">January 12</div>
<h4>Introduction and course overview</h4>
Today we handle who, when, and why. We will introduce ourselves. I will
define course policies. I will provide information about the project,
about grade distribution, etc. <br>
This course is about ICTs, organizations and the role of security in organizations. The course has three primary elements. 
<br> 
First, the readings and lectures where the minimum critical topics
for literacy in organizations and information security are introduced. The readings
and lectures will focus primarily on theory, particularly looking at
organizations through the lens of economics. 
<br> 
Second, the discussion section. There will be some readings
during the discussion section, primarily those that apply to the
practical training part of the course. 
<br>
Third, the three examinations in the course. The first is on
organizational theory. The second is on economics of information. The
third is on organizational and economic aspects of
organizations. There is no comprehensive final.

<h2>Introduction to Organizations</h2> 
An organization can be considered a
single entity, a collection of competing subsets, a group of
self-optimizing individuals, a machine following a process, or a
cultural entity. In the first section of this course we will examine
each of those models. 
For three of the models the reading will be <q>Essence of Decision</q>.
This book is about the interaction of nation states rather than the
interactions of businesses. However, in terms of the descriptions of
three of these models there is no other reading that is short but
informative. There are more tedious readings, and readings made terse
by assumptions of the education of the reader. Therefore, the classic
by Allison will be used to discuss the issues. I will provide a very
short introduction to rational choices, and then examine the limits of
rationality. We return to the limits of rationality topic in Economics
and Uncertainty.

<h2>What are Organizations</h2>
<div class="sideBox">Jan 14: Org Theory.</div>
<div class="noteBox">Organizational Models? </div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
What are organizations: individual rational actors, collections of groups or
stakeholders, and as groups of political individuals with their own
visions and power struggles. Shafritz offers a larger view. What is an
organization? To what organizations do you belong? If you were to
design an web site for two organizations to which you belong what
would be public, and what private? How much would identity management
matter at a fraternity web site versus a departmental one? How would
privacy concerns differ?
<h4>Readings</h4>
Classics of Organization Theory, (6th Edition) by Jay M. Shafritz, Steven Ott, and Yong
Suk Jang; pp 1- 26.

Until 1964, single rational organizations seeking employees listed them in four
categories: white man wanted, black man wanted, white woman wanted and
black woman wanted. Listing by race was prohited by the 1964 Civil
Rights Act. By 1971, listing jobs by gender was judged to be
prohibited as well. <A href=images/HelpWantedGender.jpg>Here is one
job listing</a>.   Notice in the first that typing was a <q>female</q> task, and notice that Bell was hiring women as Telephone Operators.
<a href=images/HelpWantedGender2.jpg> here in the next page</a>. At this time programming was considered
typing which was, as you
can see from the other job listings, undeniably <A

<div class="sideBox">Jan. 26: Org Theory.</div ="sidebox">
<div class="noteBox">Organizations as Compilation of Stakeholders</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>Organizations are not
always entirely rational. Ironically, the rational organization
understands itself as being created by a group of components, and tries
to construct mechanisms to create effective interactions between the
components. Understanding the components of the organization can
prevent the creation of perverse incentives. <h4> Reading</h4>

<div class="noteBox"> Organizations as Cultures</div>

their waking hours are work. Workplaces are not neutral or free from
emotion. Workplaces have their own cultures, some of which are
successfully cultured by management.

<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
From where do organizations come? Is it just the cooperation of a many
people? Economic forces? Group psychology? Indeed, business are
presented in media and academy as distinct and clear opposites. Yet in
fact their interaction is quite deep and profound. Government plays a
critical role in creating markets.

<div class="noteBox">Naming, Risk and Culture</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Naming and trust are traditionally bound online in a manner that makes sense offline. If I know you by name offline I am likely to have a context; e.g. a social organization or neighborhood or religious community. However, a name online does not provide the same level of certainty. What is in a name? A rose by any other name, in theory, would smell as sweet. However, hazelnuts are considered somewhat gourmet while filberts were strictly for the common palette. While dried plums could be desirable, prunes have no such connotation.
