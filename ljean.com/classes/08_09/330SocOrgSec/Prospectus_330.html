<br>
<h2>Grading Guidelines</h2>
I will have a poll in class to determine office hours.
<br>
The
participation grade will be based on class performance. There
will be periodic quizzes on the material to determine if you have read
the material. You must read the material to do well in the
course.
<br>
Each student will be assigned to at least one debate team. You must
participate in this element of the course. Some people
may do more than one, as if you fail to appear for one debate then you
will be assigned two. If you fail to appear for two you will be
assigned three. If you fail to attend all three of these, you will
fail the class. You must present your argument clearly, be factually
informed at least to mastery of the details of the readings provided for
the course on the topic, and be professional in appearance as well as 
demeanor. These will occur in Friday discussion.
<br>
The three tests will correspond to the three major themes of the course.

<h2>Overview</h2>
This class is divided into three  major themes, with sessions organized under those themes. <br>
The course has three intellectual  pillars. The first pillar of the course is the material provided in the readings, and the lectures on the reading. The second is your class participation. If you are shy about speaking up in class you can participate in OnCourse. The third is the discussion sections. You cannot participate if you do not attend.
<h3>Course Themes</h3>
The first major theme is the nature of organizations. 
An organizations can be perceived as single monolithic rational entity; as a collection of competing groups of stakeholders; as a collection of individuals each acting upon their own aims; as a machine irrationally following process; or a anthropological cultural entity.
Each of these views of organizations has implications for the use of data and of information technology. The understanding of how organizations alter the nature of IT is part of what differentiates Informatics from CS.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The second major theme is information economics. The economics section includes a cursory introduction to some major concepts in economics: discounted cash flow, rationality, productivity, and uncertainty. 
This includes a discussion of digital networked goods violate fundamental assumptions of economics.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The final theme is a topical discussion of information economics combines with organizations.  Under this section we will consider security, privacy, DRM and copyright as economic rather than policy or technical questions.
