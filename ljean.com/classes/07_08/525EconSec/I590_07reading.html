</a><h2> The Course in a Nutshell</a></h2>  
</a><div class="noteBox"> Aug 27</a></div>
<h4> Introduction and course overview</a></h4>
 <br><br>
In the initial class meeting I ask that you write down what
particularly interest you in the topic.
Are you more interested in the methods or the findings? Is your heart
in HCI or are you the soul of business? What level of mathematical
discussion is appropriate for the course?
The course will be designed to serve the needs of the students in it.

 Questionnaire: Learning Economics of Security

</a><h2> What is Economics of Security?</a></h2>  
</a><div class="noteBox"> Aug 29  Thinking About Security From Economics</a></div>
<h4> Questions to consider during reading</a></h4>
 Here is an essay about economics by Bruce Schneier.
It was a keynote from the Workshop on the Economics of Information
Security. The five questions are not theoretical economics, not do they
use much of the language. However, these questions are the ones that
you cannot answer without economics.

  Security as Economics </a></div>
<h4> Questions to consider during reading</a></h4>
 Here we move towards a more formal explanation that
integrates security and economics. Bruce describes how economics assist
security professionals in asking questions. The security market is one
with obtuse claims, and diffuse contractual requirements. When reading
this paper, come up with your own reasoned definition of security. In
class we will examine some of the white papers and materials from
security providers, and view them through the lens of these works.

<div class="noteBox">Sept 26   Security - The Invisible, Undesirable Good</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>Security is not inherently
constructive. Security protects an entity so it can function; it does
not directly augment that functionality. Sometimes security goes
against the interest of the users; for example, with DRM. Therefore
most users have a mixed relationship with security. Despite the
stunning success of such novelties as invisible dogs at theme parks and
pet rocks, those goods with invisible value do not, in general, sell
well. This paper argues that making security visible is critical to its
success.

there are obvious benefits.

<div class="noteBox">Oct 3  Defining a Security  Market </div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Security is not a single
market. It is a set of markets: spyware, virus detection, firewalls,
spam, etc. How is it that those markets develop into distinct or
combined markets, and why this makes economic sense. And how larger trends in the ICT market influence the security market.

<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
<q>Computers are everywhere but in the productivity numbers</q> is the famous summation of the productivity paradox. The productivity paradox indicates that the investment in computers is not clearly reflected in measurements of productivity or output. If measuring the results of investment in IT is difficult, are there reasns to expect the investment in securing IT be any more or less deifficult?

<h2>Economics of Privacy</h2>

<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Why is all the information compiled about consumers online? Is it all
information psychosis - companies want it because they want it? What
data are valuable and why?Think about your own decisions and how you
evaluate them over time. And why you might hold some information more
dear than other information.

read? How is it reliable?
<br><br>When someone sells your information, what is it that troubles you?
In an experiment asking people to share their information, people are
concerned about how it will influence them later. How do we resolve

<h2>Digital Rights Management</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Nov 7   DRM in the Market </div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>What are the goals of
security in theory? How does this differ from how
it is used in practice? One value of economics of security is that it
examines how to look at security as it might function in the
marketplace as opposed to in theory.

This paper is both about the importance of patching and vulnerabilites,
