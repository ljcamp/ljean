</center>



<h2>Overview: The Course in a Nutshell</h2> 
<div class="noteBox">Jan 7</div>
<h4>Introduction and course overview</h4>
The topics the first day are who, when, and why. We will introduce ourselves. I will
descibe the course policies. I will provide information about the project,
about grade distribution, and answer any of your questions.  <br> <br>
This course is about ICTs, organizations and your role in the organization. The course has three primary elements. 
<br>  <br>
First, the readings and lectures contain the  minimal critical information
for literacy. The readings
and lectures will focus primarily on theory, particularly looking at
organizations through the lens of economics. There are also, obviously, readings on organizational theory. 
<br>  <br>
Second, the discussion section. There will be some readings
during the discussion section, primarily those that apply to the
practical training part of the course. 
<br>  <br>
Third is the practical training. The project is an experience in
team management. It includes writing a workplan, implementing the work
plan, and filling out an evaluation of your peers. Most of you are
attending this University to broaden your horizons and increase your
employment-relevant skills. This project, properly executed, will do
both. At the end of the project you should have a considerably expanded
knowledge of your subject, improved presentation skills, and an
extremely cursory introduction to project management. Regular deadlines
during the semester are intended to force the groups not to wait until
the last moment to complete the project.

<div class="noteBox">Jan 9  What Governs?</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Technologists understand that code embeds constraints. Law and social norms also determine outcomes.

<div class="noteBox">Jan 14  Technology as Policy</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Roger Dingledine and Paul Syverson describe the technology and politics of Tor. 
Tor is a strictly technical system built for political reasons. The code is open, thus fllowing traditional legal practices of transparency. Do any of you use it? Do social norms explain this? 
<h4>Readings</h4>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2> 
<div class="noteBox">Jan 16  Security and Competition</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
What are the goals of security in theory? How does this differ from how
it is used in practice? Would the security strategies discussed in
Anderson work with open code?

on-line version Trust and Risk you will print the entire book. Also
note that this is the free and thus <b>not</b> the  edited version.

<div class="sideBox">Group formation and project ideas due.</div>
<div class="noteBox">Jan 23  Technology as an Organizational Construct</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>From where do
organizations come? Is it just the cooperation of a many
people? Economic forces? Group psychology? Technologies, government and  business are
presented in media and academy as distinct and clear opposites from
government. Yet in
fact their interaction is quite deep and profound. Government plays a
critical role in creating markets and businesses just as the
environment plays a critical role in creating ecosystems and species.

<h2>Organizational Models</h2>
An organization can be considered a
single entity, a collection of competing subsets, a group of
self-optimizing individuals, a machine following a process, or a
cultural entity. In the first section of this course we will examine
each of those models. 
I will provide a very
short introduction to rational choices, and then examine the limits of
rationality. We return to the limits of rationality topic in Economics
and Uncertainty.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="sideBox">First draft of biliography due.</div>
<div class="noteBox">Feb 4 Organizations as Single Rational Beings</div>

stakeholders, and as groups of political individuals with their own

<br><p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Feb  6  Organizations as Compilation of Stakeholders</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>Organizations are not
always entirely rational. Ironically, the rational organization
understands itself as being created by a group of components, and tries
to construct mechanisms to create effective interactions between the
components. Understanding the components of the organization can
prevent the creation of perverse incentives.

 <h2>Decision - Making Tools in Economics</h2>
Economics has developed a series of tools that are widely used in daily
business analysis. This section of the course will introduce a few of
those tools, and focus on the potential of these tools to enable
analytical insights. 


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="noteBox">March 3 Life's a Game</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
In classical economics life is never a beach, and joy is not an option. However, life can certainly be modeled as a game. We self-optimize and implement strategies according to our expectations of each other's behavior. For example, do you expect to be able to skip this reading and not be quized? What are your odds, and what is your expectation of my quiz-giving strategy?
