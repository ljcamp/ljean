<table width ="80%" summary="Grading Percentages" border="0" align="center">

<br><br>
Participation in the classroom and in the discussion area in On-Course are both credited. If you are more comfortable speaking than writing, or more comfortable writing as opposed to speaking, you may choose only one. Participation should illustrate that any assigned reading has been complete, or when there are no readings that the course presentation was carefully watched. Participation professional in tone  will not be counted as a positive contribution. To be perfectly clear, any student who diminishes the contributions of less advanced students will find his or her own grade suffers.
<br><br>
In terms of the weekly writing, each week there is a 300 word commentary on the lecture. The commentary may be a summary, or a comment, or you may ask a question, or you may connect the lecture to some current event. The commentary must illustrate awareness (to be passable) and understanding (to be excellent) of the lecture materials. Grammar and spelling count.

Notice all of these sessions cannot fit into one semester. However, these examples of past sessions illustrate the possible diversity of the lecture
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Oct. 24 Peer Production of Security</h4> 
<center><em>
Jean Camp, Associate Professor of Informatics
</center></em>
The best deterrant to crime is public view. Are you ever in a crowd on-line? How can a group of naive people create reliable information about security?


<h4>Oct. 31 Ubiquitous Security</h4> 
<center><em> 
Professor Kay Connelly, Associate Professor, Computer Science.
</center></em>
As computers become as ubiquitous as lighting, can privacy be maintained?


<h4>Nov. 7 Cryptography</h4> 
<center><em>
Steve Myers, Assistant Professor, Informatics.
</center></em>
The mastery of mathematics meant millions of lives saved in WW II. Today it means billions of dollars in Internet commerce. 


<h4> Nov. 14 Security in Practice</h4>
<center><em>
Mark Bruhn, Chief IT Security and Policy Officer, IU.
</center></em>
Security in theory is different from in practice. What does it mean to secure a network? How do network managers view security, and what are the real-world threats likely to be faced by security managers. 

<h4>Nov. 21 Happy Thanksgiving</h4> 
Thanksgiving is a celebration of coming together in the third English settlement in the Americas. The <A href=http://www.nps.gov/fora/>first English colony</a> was destroyed during warfare with the local people and the second defended itself fiercely (<A href=http://www.apva.org/history/index.html> Jamestown</a>).  Like the network today, both cooperation and the need for security played critical roles in early settlement of America.


<h4>Nov. 28 Malware on the Network</h4> 
<center><em>
Raquel Hill,  Assistant  Professor, Informatics and Computer Science.
</center></em>
Connectivity is exposure. Network risks include denial of service, masquerade attacks, and directing hacking assaults. This session will focus on understanding the threats created on and in the network. 

<h4>Dec. 5 Forensic Security</h4> 
<center><em>
<A href= http://www.speedacm.org/~drwamp01>Doug Wampler</a>
</center></em>
How do you pick up a digital trail? What data do we leave behind on our drives, and clicks, and passages through virtual space?
