<br><br>
Participation in the classroom and in the discussion area in On-Course are both credited. If you are more comfortable speaking than writing, or more comfortable writing as opposed to speaking, you may choose only one. Participation should illustrate that any assigned reading has been complete, or when there are no readings that the course presentation was carefully watched. Participation professional in tone  will not be counted as a positive contribution. To be perfectly clear, any student who diminishes the contributions of less advanced students will find his or her own grade suffers.
<br><br>
In terms of the weekly writing, each week there is a 300 word commentary on the lecture. The commentary may be a summary, or a comment, or you may ask a question, or you may connect the lecture to some current event. The commentary must illustrate awareness (to be passable) and understanding (to be excellent) of the lecture materials. Grammar and spelling count.

<div class="noteBox">Course Session Overview</div class="noteBox">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>March 4: Net Trust and Security</h4> 
<center><em>
Brandon Stephens, Graduate Researcher
</center></em>
Stephens will provide an overview of Net Trust as an example of the security research that occurs at IU. He will describe the spring break course assignment, which is also available on OnCourse.

<h4>March 18: Security Protocols</h4> 
<center><em>
L Jean Camp,  Associate Professor, Informatics. 
</center></em>
What is privacy? What is security? How do they differ? Intorduction to the basic vocabulary of security and the IU security curriculum.

<h4>March 25: Privacy in Practice</h4>
<center><em> 
Camilo Viecco, Doctoral Reseacher
</center></em>
What resources are available to give students privacy in daily practice? What threats do Tor, PGP, and proxies mitigate?


<h4>April 1: Malware on the Network</h4> 
<center><em>
Raquel Hill,  Assistant  Professor, Informatics and Computer Science.
</center></em>
Connectivity is exposure. Network risks include denial of service, masquerade attacks, and directing hacking assaults. This session will focus on understanding the threats created on and in the network. 


<h4>April 8: Ubiquitous Security</h4> 
<center><em> 
Professor Kay Connelly, Associate Professor, Computer Science.
</center></em>
As computers become as ubiquitous as lighting, can privacy be maintained?

<h4>April 15: Wireless in Theory and Practice</h4> 
<center><em>
Matt Hottell, Lecturer and Researcher in Informatics
</center></em>
Economics and the study of risks indicates that risk, education, and ability should predict use of wireless encryption at home. But does the data support the theory?
 

<h4>April 22: Usable Security</h4>
<center><em>
Tonya Stroman, Graduate Researcher
</center></em>
Usability and human interaction are a core part of the Informatics learning experinece.For students who choose Informatics as a major as well as security as a minor, this will provide a window into your future educational experience.
