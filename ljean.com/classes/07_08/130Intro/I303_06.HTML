<h2>The Course in a Nutshell</h2> 
<div class="noteBox">August 29</div>
<h4>Introduction and course overview</h4>
Today we handle who, when, and why. We will introduce ourselves. I will
define course policies. I will provide information about the project,
about grade distribution, etc. <br>
This course is about ICTs, organizations and your role in the organization. The course has three primary elements. 
<br> 
First, the readings and lectures where the minimum critical topics
for literacy in organization informations are introduced. The readings
and lectures will focus primarily on theory, particularly looking at
organizations through the lens of economics. 
<br> 
Second, the discussion section. There will be some readings
during the discussion section, primarily those that apply to the
practical training part of the course. 
<br> 
Third is the practical training. The project is an experience in
team management. It includes writing a workplan, implementing the work
plan, and filling out an evaluation of your peers. Most of you are
attending this University to broaden your horizons and increase your
employment-relevant skills. This project, properly executed, will do
both. At the end of the project you should have a considerably expanded
knowledge of your subject, improved presentation skills, and an
extremely cursory introduction to project management. Regular deadlines
during the semester are intended to force the groups not to wait until
the last moment to complete the project.
<br>


<h2>Organizational Models</h2> 
An organization can be considered a
single entity, a collection of competing subsets, a group of
self-optimizing individuals, a machine following a process, or a
cultural entity. In the first section of this course we will examine
each of those models. 
For three of the  models the reading will be <q>Essence of Decision</q>.
This book is about the interaction of nation states rather than the
interactions of businesses. However, in terms of the descriptions of
three of these models there is no other reading that is short but
informative. There are more tedious readings, and readings made terse
by assumptions of the education of the reader. Therefore, the classic
by Allison will be used to discuss the issues. I will provide a very
short introduction to rational choices, and then examine the limits of
rationality. We return to the limits of rationality topic in Economics
and Uncertainty.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Aug 31   Session 1: Organizations as Single Rational Beings</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>There are three models of
organizations: individual rational actors, collections of groups or
stakeholders, and as groups of political individuals with their own
visions and power struggles. <h4>Readings</h4>
<br>Allison "Essence of Decision", The Rational Actor, pp. 13 26. 
<br>Tversky and Kahneman,  "Rational Choice and the Framing of Decisions" in Rational Choice, Hogarth and Reder, eds., pp. 67-94.

<br><p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Sept.  5  Session 2: Organizations as Compilation of Stakeholders</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>Organizations are not
always entirely rational. Ironically, the rational organization
understands itself as being created by a group of components, and tries
to construct mechanisms to create effective interactions between the
components. Understanding the components of the organization can
prevent the creation of perverse incentives. <h4> Reading</h4>
<br>Allison, <q>Essence of Decision</q>, Model II: Organizational Behavior, pp. 143-160. 



<br><p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Sept. 7   Session 3: Organizations as Competing Individuals</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
<q>Individuals share power. They differ about what must be done. Differences matter.</q>
<h4> Reading</h4>
<br>Allison, <q>Essence of Decision</q>, Model II: Organizational Behavior, pp. 143-160. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Information in the Organization</h2> While I am traveling, Dr.
Kalpana will add a discussion of data as a function or expression of an
organization.The topics are use of data in an organization. Consider,
for example, the use of the same data in the B2B and B2C realm. In one
case, consumer data may define what to produce. In the other, the data
will define a marketing campaign. <div class="sideBox">Guest lecture  by Dr. Kalpana Shankar.</div>
<div class="noteBox">Sept. 12  Session 1:  Electronic Records Management</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
To what extent are data and its uses shaped by an organization? How can
examining an organization assist in determination of the needed data?
<h4>Readings</h4>

How do organizations evaluate data once it is available. 
<h4>Readings</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Organizational Models Continued</h2> More conceptual models of
organizations. Each of these applies to most organizations in
difference decision contexts. Determining the context of a debate can
help you win internal debates.
<div class="sideBox">Group formation and project ideas due.</div>
<div class="noteBox">Sept. 19  Session 4: Organizations as Policy Constructs</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>From where do
organizations come? Is it just the cooperation of a many
people? Economic forces? Group psychology? Indeed, business are
presented in media and academy as distinct and clear opposites from
government. Yet in
fact their interaction is quite deep and profound. Government plays a
critical role in creating markets and businesses just as the
environment plays a critical role in creating ecosystems and species.

successfully cultured by management.
