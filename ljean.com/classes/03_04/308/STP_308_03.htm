As software and computer networksbecome more complex policy makers are faced with a bewildering array of claimsabout the future. Simultaneously designers who seek to be good engineers andgood citizens have little guidance beyond market pressure on how to embodyhuman decency into machine-generated code. </p><p>This class examines how values are embedded into software. Code is not law,yet code can rule and limit. </p><p>The majority of this class consists of examinations of particulartechnologies which have been designed for particular values or have had thosevalues assigned to them by social or technical critics. Technologies have beendesigned for privacy, to defeat censorship, to defeat censorware, and toprovide anonymous platforms for speech. A significant portion of the class willfocus on highly distributed or peer-to-peer systems. </p><p><b><i>Assignments &amp; Grading </i></b></p><p>1.

The project will either be ananalysis of a chosen technology or protocol on the basis of the values itembodies or a proposal of a new architecture of proposal which is designed with a specificvalue in mind. Acceptable projects include not only digital projects, but public architecture decisions such as Dutch bikeway design and private architectural decisions such as physical product design</p><p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'>Project Grading </p><table border=0.25 cellpadding=1 width="75%"> <tr>  <td>  <p>Initial project  plan, including areas of responsibility for each group member</p>  </td>  <td>  <p>10%</p>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td>  <p>Presentation</p>  </td>  <td>  <p>10%</p>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td>  <p>Final written  project</p>  </td>  <td>  <p>30%</p>  </td> </tr> <tr>  <td>  <p>Group  self-assessments </p>  </td>  <td>  <p>10%</p>  </td> </tr></table></body></html>
