<P><H2>Overview</H2>
<P>Information is not a simple good.  None of the assumptions of traditional markets apply to digital networked information. There is no rivalry or excludability in digital goods. Digital networks amplify the distinctions between normal and information goods by order of magnitude.  Information can be controlled or provided freely; stored or discarded. There are costs to both approaches.  
<P>
<P>This is a course for managers: those who would be CIOs and those who would manage CIOs. Management of information is a core responsibility of government. That increasingly requires understanding the management of digital information. Information alone requires a distinct set of management approaches to optimize its use.  Flexibility and reliability are critical.

 <H2>Course Outline</H2>
<P>
<P><H3>Topic 1:  The Difference is Digital </H3>
<P>Digital networks removed information from the economics of the physical media onto which it was been grafted by the industrial revolution.  Information, removed from the covers of books and ripped from CD's, has very different characteristics than when bound to physical media. The implications of this are that information markets can be constructed into vastly different forms using technology and law. 
<P>
<P<H3>Topic 2: Network Economics</H3>
<P>Maintaining the full range of later choices is a critical element underlying individual decisions where there is great uncertainty in the future. In a networked system previous choices and even the previous or simultaneous choices of others can alter the dynamics of individual decisions.  In particular some choices result in an end to future competition, sometimes in apparently unrelated markets, and  choices create virtuous (or vicious) cycles.  
<P><H3>Topic  3: Coded Choices </H3>
<P>Code is a strategic tool. Code can be a service, embedded speech or a machine depending on the licensing scheme.   Such distinctions have very real implications for the user population and the institutional options. For example, the day you graduate form the Kennedy School you are almost certainly a pirate and a criminal. If you continue to use the software license granted to you by KSG as a KSG student you are violating the law. Discussions and in-class examples from developed nations, developing nations, and from US states. 
<P><H3>Topic 4: Policy Dilemmas</H3>
<P>The economics of peer to peer systems,  the feasibility of reputation systems and the problems of privacy all create personal, public and organizational dilemmas.
<P>
<P><H3>Topic  5: Case Studies </H3> 
<P>Cases include innovations at the state level, the federal level, and in Thailand.
