Introduction and Overview</div>
In the initial class meeting I ask that you write down what particularly interest you in the topic. Are you more interested in the methods or the findings? Is your heart in HCI or are you the soul of business? What level of mathematical discussion is appropriate for the course? The course will be designed to serve the needs of the students.
<h4>Questions to consider during  Reading</h4>
What would be your ideal outcome for this course? What do you hope to learn? Can you imagine applying this at this time?

Computer Security as Economics </div>
<h4>Questions to consider during  Reading</h4>
Notice that the answer to the question &quot;Why information security is hard?&quot; is not because mathematics is sublime. Rather, the work on the fundamentals continues in a scientific (but unpredictable) manner, while adoption of basic solutions occurs in fits, booms, or not at all.

Economics as Applied to Computer Security  </div>
<h4>Questions to consider during  Reading</h4>
<br>Security is not a single market. Please consider three possible examples where Varian's model holds in each. For example, in the internal market within a firm, what kind of model would be appropriate for patching individual machines?

Basic Observations in Economics of Security </div>
<h4>Questions to consider during  Reading</h4>
<br>The reason that there is economics of security is because there are violations of security based on economics, e.g. crime. These papers address the economics of crime, the incentives and the nature of the proverbial beast. Are these numbers what you expect? Credit card number prices appear to be going down. Think about two opposite reasons why this might be the case.

<div class="noteBox"">Sept 14*
Economic Behavior</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during  Reading</h4>
Why are we willing to take the risks that we take? What makes us unwilling to pay $1 for something one moment that will be worth ten times that in another? Is it true that <q>He who hesitates is lost?</q> or is it critical to loop before one leaps? Humans are not rational when it comes to risk -- economic or networked.

the market are well understood by buyer and seller. This lecture will
include a basic introduction to marginal cost, marginal price,
competitive and monopolistic markets.

Why do firms share information that could be embarrassing about their
security state? There are obvious costs, but even when some firms lie,
there are obvious benefits. Note these are somewhat classic articles now.
