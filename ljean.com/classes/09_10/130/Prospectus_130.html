Introduction to Cybersecurity is designed to provide undergraduate
students with a 10,000 ft overview of both cybersecurity as a concept
and an area of study. The course will provide an opportunity to hear
not only the faculty but also the professionals who protect the Indiana
University network. Participation does not require understanding more
than the lecture; as there are no technical requirements for taking the
course. The course is ideal for those students who are enrolled in
Informatics or Computer Science; but it is also extremely accessible to
those who are simply curious as to the risks they face on the network.
The material will be targeted at a level appropriate for freshman, and
clarifying questions are more than welcome. <p>&nbsp;</p>

</p>
In terms of participation both in the classroom and in the discussion
area in On-Course are considered. If you are more comfortable speaking
than writing, or more comfortable in writing than speaking, you may
choose only one. Participation should illustrate that any assigned
reading has been complete. Participation that is not professional in
manner will not be counted as a positive contribution. Please treat your colelagues in the classroom with respect on the principle of the matter. Please also note that participation that is counter-productive and unprofessional will be counted against the participant. 
<br>
<br>In terms of the weekly quizes, each week there is a quiz on OnCourse based on the material as presented in the lecture. The quiz may be more of a summary, or based on a highlight, or even on responses to other student's questions. Take notes, and the quiz will be easy for you. The online quizes are designed to test your awareness (to be
passable) and understanding (to be excellent) of the lecture materials.

<div class="noteBox">Overview</div>
<center>This course introduces students to network and computer security. The course will
primarily focus on introduction to three core areas (technical aspects
of security in practice, organizational aspects of security, and the material that a student minoring in security will see). Through examples of security problems in real life, this
course will illuminate fundamental ideas and concepts of information
security. </center>

<center>This eight week course has not been fully scheduled at the time this is written, in August, before many people return from their summer travels. The sessions below are examples from past year, not commitments from the speakers to participate this year. Obviously, the first session is set, as I teach the course so I know I will be available. </center>


<h4>Session 1: The Course in a Nutshell</h4> 
<center><em>
Professor <a href="http://www.ljean.com/">Jean Camp</a> 
</em></center><em></em>

Introduction to the basic concepts of security. Introduction to the faculty, grading and class organization. 

<h4> Security in Practice</h4> How does security function as
an organizational and ethical construct? How does security interact
with organizational and social informatics?
<center><em>
Mark Bruhn, Chief IT Security and Policy Officer, IU.
</em></center><em></em>Security in theory is different from in
practice. What does it mean to secure a network? How do network
managers view security, and what are the real-world threats likely to
be faced by security managers.

<h4> Security Mathematics</h4> 
<center><em>
Steve Myers, Associate Professor, Informatics. 
</em></center><em></em>
Cryptography has been used since the time of the ancient Egyptians, and
historically has been used mostly for military purposes. We will
introduce the notion of cryptography; briefly discuss the huge effect
it has had on human history; discuss how in modern times cryptography
is being used for more and more commercial (and thus non-military)
applications. We will briefly discuss the one-time pad, substitution
ciphers, symmetric key cryptography, and public-key cryptography.
<h4> Security in the Network</h4> 
<center><em>
Raquel Hill,  Assistant  Professor, Informatics and Computer Science.
</em></center><em></em>Connectivity is exposure. Network risks include
denial of service, masquerade attacks, and directing hacking assaults.
This session will focus on understanding the threats created on and in
the network.


<h4> Happy Thanksgiving</h4> 
Thanksgiving is a celebration of coming together in the third English colony, and the second surviving English settlement, in the Americas. The first English colony was destroyed during warfare with the local people and the second defended itself fiercely to survive (<A href=http://www.apva.org/history/index.html> Jamestown</a>). Like the network today, both cooperation and the need for security played critical roles in early settlement of America. Please check OnCourse for your assignment for this week!


<h4> Privacy in Ubicomp</h4>
<center><em>
Kay Connelly, Associate Professor of Computer Science.
</em></center><em></em>
Security is based on concepts of transactions, log-in and specified
roles. Ubicomp violates all those assumptions. What does it mean if you
are authenticating by walking into a room? Security policies, privacy
issues and security in practice are the topics of this session.
<h4>Security &amp; Incentives </h4> 
<center><em>
Xiaofeng Wang, Assistant Professor of Informatics.
</em></center><em></em>
Security can be used to create a set of incentives or to limit interaction. Introduction to security as an economic concept. 
<h4>Security at Indiana</h4> 
<center><em>
University Security Practitioners and Faculty
</em></center>
Security research and degree programs at Indiana. The last session of the course essentially answers the question, <q>Where do you go from here, depending on what you enjoyed in the course?</q>
<h4>Malware in Peer to Peer Networks </h4> 
<center><em>
Minaxi Gupta, Assistant Professor of Computer Science.
</em></center>
Security is based on concepts of transactions, log-in and specified roles. P2P can violate all those assumptions. What risk are you taking when you download your music.
