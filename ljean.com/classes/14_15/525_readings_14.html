<h1>Readings </h1>
<div class="tbaBox">
Introductory Examples 
</div class="tbaBox">
<p>The first two weeks of the class will cover some fundamental examples, very early works in economics of security. These are chosen to bring the topics of both computer security and economics together for students who lack familiarity in either. 
  
  In the initial class meeting we step through the syllabus. I answer any grading queries. I describe assignments, standards and options. For the first week you have two very light assignments: a quiz and your first essay. For the quiz, I ask that you write down what particularly interest you in the topic. Are you more interested in the methods or the findings? Is your heart in HCI or are you the soul of business? What level of mathematical discussion is appropriate for the course? The lectures will be designed to serve the needs of the students, and based on your answers the syllabus may also change. More about crime? Voting?</p>
<div class="noteBox">Aug. 25 Introduction and Overview</div>
<p>What would be your ideal outcome for this course? What do you hope to learn? What topic is missing, is too lightly covered, or is too heavily considered in the following readings? 
  How does the value of email change your perspective on pricing security?
  
  Syllabus provided in class.
  A short article on monetizing of email for discussion is here:

<div class="noteBox">Aug. 27  An Economic Perspective on Security</div>
<p>This book chapter will introduce the basic argument for security as economic.  Most of the vocabulary will be defined in this session. The same book is usually used in the core security course, but that chapter will be addressed here.  <br>

<div class="noteBox">Sept. 3  Security As Economics</div>
<p>Security is not a single kind of good, and design can change the type of good. Please consider three possible examples where Karin's model holds in each. For example, in the internal market within a firm, what kind of model would be appropriate for patching individual machines? 
Similarly, how might these markets be changed by design? <br>

<div class="tbaBox"> Economics of Privacy</div>
Privacy, identity and security are all tightly intertwined. Privacy, like security, is the control of information. Identification for security purposes often requires decreases in privacy.  This section considers privacy in its own right, as well as interactions with identification.<br>&nbsp;<br>

Behavioral Economics
</div>
Economics in computer security focuses to no small degree on behavior. Individuals do not act as self-optimizing rational beings. The limits of the applicability of the model of homo economicus will be used to discuss both decision-making by firms in network security and individuals with respect to privacy. Concepts of risk aversion and risk perception will be introduced. By beginning with the framework of behavioral economics, it may be easier to understand the framework that underlies rational economics. Behavioral economics is then applied to privacy.

    <div class="tbaBox">Signaling  </div>
One domain where the interaction of security and privacy behaviors are of particular importance is in the power of social networks. Social networks can be used to enhance security or undermine it. One day the readings will focus on the value of social networks and information sharing to empower individuals as opposed to stakeholders with perverse incentives. The second day will address the risks of social networking.
