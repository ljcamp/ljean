<h3>Economics of Information Security</h3>
	
	
	
Why have market mechanisms thus far failed to create secure networks? 
<br>
The Internet is critical to all sectors of the economy and integrated
into government. Security technologies do exist, and capable
programmers can implement secure code. Programming projects and
operating systems based on secure design principles populate research
databases. Yet the network can be sabotaged by a creative teenager with
limited programming experience. <br>
Why?  
<br>
Clearly the answer to this question must include more than technology.
There is a problem in the economics of security, and more broadly in
the economics of information control. These problems emerge as security
violations, spam, "private" databases indexed by Google, and products
based on practices exposed as snake oil decades before. <br>
Thus this course begins with a four week overview of economics, a week
on this history of computer security and regulation, and then six weeks
on the economics of security and privacy.
