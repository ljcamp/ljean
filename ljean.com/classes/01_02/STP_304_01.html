Thus the class begins with   these topics. <p> The issues of privacy, consumer protection, and universal service will be   discussed only with respect to Internet commerce issues. Each student can select   a project to explore at greater depth, and I can offer additional readings for   the projects selected. <p> The beginning of the class will focus on money and the nature of the Internet.   This will include a day or so of slides which offer the typical overview of   Internet commerce as it expands. We will then examine particular systems, ever   so briefly. We will move on to discuss the concept of information economics   as framed by Varian &amp; Shapiro. Finally we will select essays from Open Sources   to discuss the various forms of licenses and how these interact with trust and   information rules. The final section of the class will be on examining how different   licenses embody different strategies, and the projects will be related to this   topic. We will include several case studies, as information commerce has illustratively   risen and fallen in the past few years. In particular we will consider Red Hat   and First Virtual. <p> Objectives of the course are: <p><ul>  <li>to understand trust on the Internet   <li>to understand how Internet commerce differs from traditional consumer instruments;   <li>to understand information economics at a simple theoretical level  <li>to understand different perspectives on policy issues on Internet commerce  <li>to be able to select decision variables for evaluation of commerce protocols  <li>to be able to evaluate the different mechanisms for marketing as embodied     in different information licenses</ul>At the least, upon completing of this coursethe student will be an informed consumer and be able to choosebetween the many options with confidence. <p> <i><b>Assignments &amp; Grading </b></i><p> 1.
