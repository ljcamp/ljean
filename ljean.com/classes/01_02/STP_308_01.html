As software and computer networks   become more complex policy makers are faced with a bewildering array of claims   about the future. Simultaneously designers who seek to be good engineers and   good citizens have little guidance beyond market pressure on how to embody human   decency into machine-generated code.<p>This class examines how values are embedded into software. Code is not law,   yet code can rule and limit. <p>The majority of this class consists of examinations of particular technologies   which have been designed for particular values or have had those values assigned   to them by social or technical critics. Technologies have been designed for   privacy, to defeat censorship, to defeat censorware, and to provide anonymous   platforms for speech. A significant portion of the class will focus on highly   distributed or peer-to-peer systems.<p> <i><b>Assignments &amp; Grading </b></i><p> 1. Class participation, 15% <p> <blockquote> Virtual and physical. </blockquote> <p> 2. Two assignments during the semester 20%<p> 3. Evaluation of another's final project based on their presentation, 10% <p><blockquote>   <p></blockquote> 3. Research Final Project 55% <p><blockquote>   <p>The project will be graded on content, sources, and quality of argument.     The project will either be an analysis of a chosen technology or protocol     on the basis of the values it embodies or a proposal of a new protocol which     is designed with a specific value in mind. </p>  <p>Project Grading </p>  <table width="75%" border="1">    <tr>      <td>Initial project plan</td>      <td>5%</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Presentation</td>      <td>10%</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Final written project</td>      <td>30%</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>Individual and group self-assessments </td>      <td>10%</td>    </tr>  </table>  <p></blockquote><h1>&nbsp; </h1> </body></html>
