<h3>Overview</h3>

Security and privacy lapses in the Internet of Things can cause real
and significant harm to people, their pets, and their homes.  Computer
security and privacy for an IoT ecosystem is fundamentally important
and challenging. From a human-centered design perspective, complex
issues arise when designing technologies for a diverse collection of
stakeholders, including vulnerable populations such as children and
those using in-home care technologies.  From a technical perspective,
security and privacy are challenging not only because of the
properties of IoT devices themselves but also because of risks that
emerge only when technologies are combined in unexpected ways. IoT
devices will be pervasive, and may have very constrained
computational, communications, and energy resources.
<br>
</p>
<p>
Meeting these challenges requires  a large, interdisciplinary
effort. A holistic approach to IoT security and privacy integrates
human-computer interaction, network security, cryptography, and
pervasive computing.  The translation layer requires an undertsanding of people&#8217;s privacy
and security requirements and the ability to expresses these as cryptographically
enforced data controls. This embeds usability and social informatics
challenges, requiring understanding what
people want and presenting these in a manner people can
understand. The home environment is one of the most complex contexts
in which to consider IoT security and privacy, due in part to the
diversity of families involved as well as the knowledge and technical
support (or lack thereof) that one can assume in terms of computer
security and privacy. This includes cryptographic challanges in
aligning the cryptographic implementations to the requirements derived
from human contexts. There is the networking challenge of
communicating these. The ability to enforce these requirements on
devices and in their interactions is a complex challenge even with the
assumption of well-behaved devices.

<h3>One Time Announcement</h3>

  href="http://www.ljean.com/classes/16_17/IoT/IoTreadings.pdf">
http://www.ljean.com/classes/116_17/IoTreadings.pdf</a> This <b>will
  not be updated</b>. As soon as you are can access Canvas, it is your
  responsibility to track updates using Canvas resources. This is a
  collaboratively taught course, so this website is the overview and
  announcement. 
<br>
</p>
<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Course Goals</h3>
Creating a more secure IoT requires more than reading and discussion, it requires
active engagement in research. The research will be informed by continuous feedback
through industry outreach, and our research collaborations both inside
and beyond the classroom.

<ul>
  <br> <li>Understand today and tomorrow&#8217;s Internet of Things,  particularly in the home
<br> <li>Understand how security influences the world around us through the integration of current affairs with the course
<br> <li>Become familiar with various applications, examples, and considerations of IoT
<br> <li>Be able to research and evaluate the potential  of a specific application for or research topic in IoT, widely construed 
<br> <li>Develop your team work skills to collaborate on creating and completing a research plan
<br> <li>Understand privacy issues surrounding IoT 
<br> <li>Understand the ways we are and can reinvent home life, fitness, healthcare, ubiquitous and pervasive computing, and social networking with IoT
<br> <li>Identify the steps, people, legislation and technologies that
  will be needed to realize services and technologies to accommodate
  the requirements for IoT
  </ul>
 
  
<br>
Grading is based on these goals. There will be a brief anonymous
survey at least once to determine how well the class is helping you
achieve these goals. Depending on the results, We may ask for
additional feedback with an additional survey. Canvas does not support
  anonymous submissions, so these are likely to be in class.
<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
  <a name="projects"></a>
<h3>Project Possibilities &amp; Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <br> <li>Data analytics project related to IoT 
<p>	Requires dataset or confirmation of data availability
  by third week</p>
<br> <li>User-centered experiment in IoT technology <br>
<p>	Requires human subjects training and certification by second week</p>
<br> <li>Threat assessment of an IoT technology or system
<p>	Requires INFO 533 or equivalent <br>
<br> <li>Create a new IoT device</p>
<p>	Requires programming ability appropriate for project </p>
<br> <li>Break an IoT device <br>
  <p>	Requires programming ability appropriate for project</p>
</ul>

Your choice of project will align you with a specific
instructor. Threat assessments and data
projects may be of interest to all the instructors. User-centered
projects are a best fit with Prof. Camp, while building and breaking
is likely to be aligned with Prof. Myers. Any cryptographic work, for
example an implementation on a constrained device, would best fit with
Prof. Myers or Prof. Henry.

<a name="grading"></a>
<h3>Grading Guidelines</h3>
<p>The primary assignment for this course is the preparation of an research plan in a team which addresses at least two dimensions of security and privacy IoT. There are 1000 potential points that you can earn in this course; 20% of the grades (200 points) are individually based and assess your class participation and contribution to group work; 60% (600 points) of your grade is determined by your group&#8217;s project; the other 20%  (200 points) is determined by specific in-class activities.  

</p>
<p>
We expect class discussion to be wide ranging. While we have readings
for each class the discussion is not bound by those readings.  Part of
this class will be brainstorming. We may take a class period, for
example, to evaluate a survey designed by one group before the group
distributes. Or we may join up in pairs to go through an experimental
protocol of one group. Alternatively we may discuss preliminary
results which seem inscrutable to a team. After you begin, your
project is a component of the course.
</p>
<p>
Many of the courses will begin with current affairs. The first few days the faculty will choose any current even to present for discussion. After that students will sign up to select a security event of the day. Unfortunately we can always count on a data breach. There are also policy events, technical breakthroughs, and new malware.
</p>
<p>
<em>Individual Assignments</em> include quizzes, in-class assignments,
online assignments,  and attendance. The individual statement of goals
is included in the project because it is focused on the project
outcome. These sum to 200 points across the semester.
</p>
<p>
<em>In-class leadership</em> includes the presentation of the hot
topic, which is a current event associated with security, privacy, and
impinging on the Internet of Things. That presentation is 50 points or
five percent of the grade. This also includes the day that your team
presents related work. We expect that presentation to include
brainstorming with the entire class, if needed. The group leadership
of the entire class is 150 points.
</p>
<p>
<em>The Project</em> consists of ten components from identification of your
individual goals for the class, through group development of an
abstract, then reification of the abstract to a researchable
question. Finally the group will come together and present the
finding, both in class as a set of appropriate documents. All of these
steps are part of the project grade because each contributes uniquely
to the final deliverable.

</p>
<p>60 points: Individual Statement of Goals</p>
<p> 50 points: 	Extended Abstract Including Method </p>
<p>50 points: 	Revised Abstract &amp; Outline  </p>
<p>70 points: Initial Research Results </p>
<p>70 points: 	Research Progress Documentation   </p>
<p>60 points: 	Initial Completed Report  </p>
<p>70 points: 	Final Completed Report </p>
<p>50 points: Final Presentation  </p>
<p>20 points: Peer Review of peer presentations</p>
<p>100 points: Turn in final plan and all slides  
<p>
Students with successful, accepted submissions to an approved
conference <em>as a poster</em> will receive an &quot;A&quot; on the presentation
component, even if this requires a change from the initial grade.  If
you complete the presentation and believe your grade is incorrect,
then polish the work and submit it. Given that the goal of this is
effective presentation;  you will receive an &quot;A&quot;
grade.  The School provides travel funds for
graduate students with publications, so you should  be able to
present.

<a name="policies"></a>
<h3>Policies</h3>
These policies are in addition to and  not a substitute for University
Academic Conduct policies.


 <p>Due dates  for assignments are firm.  The group will be subject to 10 late points for each day that an assignment is late. 
 </p>
 <p>One Late Pass is available for your group this semester. Because of the fast pace of the course, your group may use one late pass, and have one additional week to turn in one assignment.
 </p>
 <p>Attendance is expected and will be monitored.  You may miss two classes without penalty. More than 5 absences will result in an automatic F. You may also be excused for religious holidays. Please let us know by the first week of class if you are intending to miss for any religious holidays. 
 </p>
 <p>Assignments should be professional in appearance and should follow current APA format.  Please seek help from the 5th edition of the APA Manual or the campus Writing Center.
</p>
 <p>Academic and personal misconduct by students is defined and will be dealt with according to the newly revised procedures in the CODE OF STUDENT ETHICS.  Be sure to review cheating and plagiarism.  Plagiarism constitutes using others&#8217; ideas, words or images without properly giving credit to those sources. If you turn in any work with your name affixed to it, I assume that work is your own and that all sources are indicated and documented in the text (with quotations and/or citations). Any written work that appears to be plagiarized will be submitted to Turnitin.com. 
 </p>
 <p>


Video and audio recording of the course is not allowed. The class time includes discussion. Asking a question is difficult for some people, being recorded increases the burden of asking. I expect the class participants, as graduate students, to be able to answer the questions and engage fully in classroom exercises.  This means that there will be moments of disagreement, and even intellectual struggle or conflict.  Experience indicates and research does not contradict the assertion that recording hinders discussion and the education that requires it. A violation of this class policy will be treated as a violation of academic integrity.
</p>
 <p>
If you have a particular need to record you may do so unobtrusively and under a confidentiality agreement that respects the expectations of other students. Please talk to me privately about this.
</p>
 <p>
The class has a set of basic topics, and each topic will be explored
and examined according to the interest of the students. Thus, if the
class wants to focus an additional day on a topic, other topics can be
compressed. What is important is to meet the goals of the class.
