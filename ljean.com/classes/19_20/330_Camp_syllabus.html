            will be evaluated on the thoroughness and accuracy of the information you present, the content of
            the slides, the design of the slides, and effectiveness of delivery. To mitigate the difficulty of
            going first, to put this off to the last minute, choosing the last slot of the semester is plus 0
            points. Choosing one of the first four available slots will be plus 4 points. Any other slot is
            plus 2 points.

            or fails to attend will be penalized. It is important to attend discussion because this will be
            primarily time for guided work on your projects. There will also be activities that compliment the
            course as a whole. For example, as part of threat modeling we will visit the finest puzzle
            collection in the world which is housed in Lilly Library. Before you determine your projects I hope to
            schedule a tour of the various resources available to help. </td>
