 <p><a 
      href="classes/05_06/Prospectus_535.html">Economics of Information Security</a><br>
    The language of computer security suggest the range of analogies. A virus is a medical problem, while an invasive worm brings to mind the problems of ecosystems.   Computer crime and intrusion detection argue that the problem is one of criminal behavior. Firewalls suggest that the network itself is a hostile force, that must be segregated into  the conflagration beyond and the safety within. The construction of demilitarized zones (DMZs) between trusty local area networks  and the wider network beyond argues that it is war, not flames,  on the network. Yet for all that is involved in computer security, and all that is lost, there is a potential measure: dollars.
<br> <p><a 
      href="classes/04_05/303/Prospectus_303.html">Organizational Informatics</a> <br>     
Organizational Informatics addresses the issue of information in an organization. In this class we examine the competing models of organizations, introduce some concepts fundamental to economics, briefly touch upon th e organization of different types of markets, and close with presentations by the students.

	  <h3>Classes for the 2003-2004 academic year </h3>
	  <p><a 
      href="classes/03_04/483/STM_483_04.html">STM 483: Information Management</a> <br>       Information management begins with an introduction to the unique economic implications of digital on-line information.  The course provides an understanding of the concepts of managing digital information, then an application of these concepts in the final. </p>
	  <p><a 
      href="classes/03_04/308/STP_308_03.html">STP 308: Technical Design and Human Values</a> <br>       How are value and political choices designed into technology? How do distinct values emerge from the same
      technologies? How can policy makers recognize  values and prevent hard-wired technological value choices? This class begins with two weeks of theory, but the focus of this class is a series of information technology case studies.  2001-2002 was the first year this course was offered, under the name Design for Values. </p>

	  <p><a 
      href="classes/03_04/301/STP_301_03.html">STP 301: Security and Privacy </a><br>
      Technology is being presented in popular discourse as a savior from the threats of terrorism, and conversely as threat to democracy with the hard-wiring of  big brother. Accountability and anonymity seem to be inherently opposed. The course identifies necessary trade-offs, and illustrates that many of the current security and privacy exchanges risk reducing both. Wireless identifiers on every article of clothing and the Federal Total Information Awareness program are topics in this course as they will be integral parts of our lives in a few years. Framing the class discussion are the basics of choosing security technologies for federal systems.  <br>

 <p><a       href="classes/03_04/304/STP_304_03.html">STP 304: Telecommunications Modeling Commerce       </a><br>	 Who bought the first fax machine? How did e-mail arise?  This course will focus on systems with feedback. The course will begin with an explanation of feedback, and then a series of lectures will focus on specific mechanisms for feedback in the economic and technical realm. Readings and cases will provide real world examples.  Dynamic cost-based modeling with technical uncertainty. Technical change presents an interesting set of problems for quantitative modeling. This course was originally offered as &quot;Information  and Telecommunications Protocols: Modeling and Policy Analysis&quot; in 2002.  Analysis of technology policy problems in developing countries is a rich source of material for this project-based course.</p>

	  <h3>Classes for the 2002-2003 academic year </h3><p>During this year I was on research leave, therefore I taught only a core course  on analytic methods <a 
      href="classes/02_03/API_302_02.html">Analytic 
      Frameworks for Policy.</a> </p>
            <p>
      <h3>Classes for the 2001-2002 academic year </h3>
	  <p>
	  <a href="classes/01_02/STP_304_01.html">STP 304: Internet Commerce <br>
      </a>What good are free goods, and what the business models for free software? What business models 
      survived the boom? Why did other fail? What policy choices are being and 
      have been made to balance and tilt the information markets? I developed 
      this course in 1998-1999. </p>

	  <p><a 
      href="classes/01_02/STP_308_01.html">STP 308: Design for Values</a> <br> This course focused 
      on how value choices are designed into or emerge from the design of 
      technologies. In particular this class will focus on protocols rather than 
      the interfaces of particular implementations. 2001-2002 was the first year 
      I offered this course. </p>
	  <p><a 
      href="classes/01_02/STP_301_01.html">STP 301: Communications Policy</a> <br>
      Governance has had a critical role in shaping modes and methods of 
      communications from Charlemagne to Prince Charles. In return, technologies 
      have altered social patterns, including those of governance. In this 
      course the continuing threads, repeating patterns, and new twists of 
      communications technologies are examined. This course was based on the 
      introduction to information policy two years previous. </p>

	  <p>
	  <a  href="classes/00_01/STP_304_00.html">STP 304M: The 
      Mechanisms and Methods of Internet Commerce </a><br>offered in Spring 2001. 
      Updated from the previous year. </p>

	  <a  href="classes/00_01/STP_308_00.html">STP 308: Information 
      and Telecommunications Protocols: Modeling and Policy Analysis</a><br> offered 
      in Spring of 2001. Listed as STP 308, ESD 127 at MIT and DHP P232 at the 
      Fletcher School. Analytic modeling of technical uncertainty. </p>

	  <p><a  href="99_00/STP_308_99.html">STP 308: Internet 
      Commerce: Technologies and Issues</a> <br>
	  Much of the material in this course can be found in <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0262032716/qid=1057829895/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-0891755-6154355?v=glance&s=books&n=507846>Trust and Risk in Internet Commerce</a> published the following year. </a> </p>
	  <p><a href="classes/99_00/STP_307_99.html">STP-307: Business 
      and the Internet: Strategy, Law and Policy<br>

	  </a> This had 
      been the only course previous taught on IT and policy. I took over this 
      course for one year and then developed more focused courses. In part 
      because this course was developed to ask the question about the potential 
      of the Internet. By 2000, it was obvious this topic needed more than an 
      overview course.
