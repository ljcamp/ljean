<h2>The Course in a Nutshell</h2> 
<div class="noteBox">Jan 10</div>
<h4>Introduction and course overview</h4>
<br>
In the initial class meeting I ask that you write down what particularly interest you in the topic.
Are you more interested in the methods or the findings? Is your heart in HCI or are you the soul of business? What level of mathematical discussion is appropriate for the course?
The course will be designed to serve the needs of the students in it. 
I will unavoidable be in Delhi for this meeting.

<br>Questionnaire: Learning Economics of Security

<h2>What is Economics of Security?</h2> 
<div class="noteBox">Jan 12    Session 1: Thinking About Security From Economics</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Here is an essay about economics by Bruce Schneier. It was a keynote from the Workshop on the Economics of Information Security. The five questions are not theoretical economics, not do they use much of the language. However, these questions are the ones that you cannot answer without economics.
<br>Bruce Schneier, Evaluating Security Systems, Ch20, pp 289 - 294.
<Br>Dan Geer, <q>Making Choices to Show ROI</q> Secure Business Quarterly.

</rb><p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Jan 17    Session 2:Security as Economics </div>
Here we move towards a more formal explanation that integrates security and economics. Bruce describes how economics assist security professionals in asking questions. Ross explains why those questions must be asked of the technology as well as the organization.
<h4> Reading</h4>
R. Anderson, <Q>Why information security is hard</Q>, ACSAC '01: Proceedings of the 17th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference, IEEE Computer Society, Washington, DC. 2001

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Jan 19    Session 3:Security  as a Broken Market </div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>The security market is one with obtuse claims, and diffuse contractual requirements. When reading this paper, come up with your own reasoned definition of security. In class we will examine some of the white papers and materials from security providers, and view them through the lens of this work.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Jan 24    Session 4: Security as Risk Management</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Security as risk management is a distinction approach. The question above approach this but these more formal guidelines offer more insight.

<h2>Individual Perspectives on Security</h2> 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Jan 26    Session 1: We Hate Security</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Security is not inherently constructive. Security protects an entity so it can function; it does not directly augment that functionality. Sometimes security goes against the interest of the users; for example, with DRM. Therefore most users have a mixed relationship with security. 
<h4>Readings</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Jan 31    Session 2: We Don't Hate Security; We Simply cannot See It</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Despite the stunning success of such novelties as invisible dogs at theme parks and pet rocks, those goods with invisible value do not, in general, sell well. This paper argues that making security visible is critical to its success.
<h4>Readings</h4>
M Sandrini and F Cerbone, <Q>We Want Security But We Hate It</q> Ch 16, pp 213-224

<h2>Security and the Firm</h2> 
 <div class="noteBox">Feb 2    Session 1: Why Companies Share Security Information</div> 
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Why do firms share information that could be embarrassing about their security state? There are obvious costs, but even when some firms lie, there are obvious benefits.
<h4>Readings</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Feb 7 Session 2: Defining a Security  Market </div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Security is not a single market. It is a set of markets: spyware, virus detection, firewalls, spam, etc. How is it that those markets develop into distinct or combined markets, and why this makes economic sense.
<h4>Readings</h4>
Anindya Ghose, Arun Sundararajan, <Q>Pricing Security Software: Theory and Evidence</Q>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Feb 9 Session 3:Special Guest</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Feb 9 Session 3: Valuing and Guiding Investment CANCELED</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Which firm should invest in security? And what kinds of security make the best investments?
<h4>Readings</h4>
Varian, <q>System Reliability and Free Riding</Q>  CH 1. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Feb 14    Session 4: Valuing Denial of Service</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
When denial of service attacks are discussed it is always assumed that all discouraged customers go away, exactly once, for the purchase they would have made had the sight been up. This paper looks at how valuations such as these might both undervalue and overvalue a denial of service attack. 
<h4>Readings</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Feb 16    Session 5: Economics of Spam</div> 
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Spam is no tasty treat. Last year AOL claimed to have stoppped its billionth spam email. Spam has significant costs in bandwidth, processing time, and attention spam of the inevitable recipients. 
<h4>Readings</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Feb 21   Session 6: Economics of Reputation</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Reputation systems are
used for ratings, for p2p download controls, for knowledge management.
Reputation systems can be considered micro payment systems, knowledge
management systems or access control systems. What, then, is a
reputation system?  What are its economic consequences?

<h2>Economics of Privacy</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Feb 23   Session 1: Privacy and Pricing</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Why is all the information compiled about consumers online?
 Is it all information psychosis - companies want it because they want it? What data are valuable and why?Think about your own decisions and how you evaluate them over time. And why you might hold some information more dear than other information.
<h4>Readings</h4>

<p>Guest speaker : To Be Determined</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Mar 7  Session 3: Privacy and the Secondary Market</div>

<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
How do you decide if you want to share information? As the information has been shared, and is diffused are you more or less concerned about past habits?
What information do you share voluntarily, on blogs or the Face Book, and what is the privacy policy of the place where you share information?
<h4>Readings</h4>
<br>Bernardo A. Huberman, Eytan Adar and Leslie R. Fine, <Q>Valuating Privacy</Q>  Fourth Workshop on Economics of Security, available at http://www.infosecon.net



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Mar 9  Session 4: Validating Your Bad Habits</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Have you ever read a privacy policy? Try reading one before class today, I recommend the Face Book or Amazon. Under what conditions can it change? Is it easy to read? How is it reliable?
<br>
When someone sells your information, what is it that troubles you? In an experiment asking people to share their information, people are concerned about how it will influence them later. How do we resolve this finding with the earlier theory of hyperbolic discounting?

<h2>Digital Rights Management</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Mar 21    Session 1:DRM versus  Security </div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
What are the goals of security in theory? How does this differ from how
it is used in practice? One value of economics of security is that it examines how to look at security as it might function in the marketplace as opposed to in theory.
<h4>Readings</h4>
Ross Anderson, Cryptography and Competition Policy: Issues with Trusted 
Computing, <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/ftp/users/rja14/tcpa.pdf">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/ftp/users/rja14/tcpa.pdf </a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <div class="noteBox">Mar 23    Session 2:DRM  Dissected</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
This reading defines copyright as a bundle of rights, rights that can now be made distinct in digital goods. How you model security or DRM depends upon the relative valuation of those rights.
<h4>Readings</h4>Camp, <q>DRM Doesn't  Really Mean Copyright</q>, IEEE Internet Computing. May 2003. http://www.ljean.org/files/DRM.pdf 16 Spring Break
<br>Spinello &amp; Tavani: Excerpts from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <div class="noteBox">Mar 28      Session 3:DRM and Pricing </div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
If you think of DRM as a negotiation, limiting the ability to use a good might limit the ability to charge for the good.

 <h2>Vulnerability Markets</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Apr 4 Session 1: Security as an Implicit Market in Vulnerabilities</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Here is the first paper that begins to take a formal economic approach to the question of economics of security. For many years before this, the question of economics as an externality was widely asserted but never formally illustrated. This is a transitional paper to the more formal work following.
<h4>Reading</h4>L Jean Camp and Catherine Wolfram, Pricing Security, CH 2, pp. 17 -35. 
<h4>Optional Reading</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Apr 6  Session 2: Defining the Vulnerability Market</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
One way to pay for vulnerabilities is using a per-package mechanism. In this ways vendors could illustrate support with measurable amounts.
<h4>Reading</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Apr 11    Session 3:Vulnerability Auctions </div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Consider an auction for vulnerabilities. This is what might effectively happen if there are multiple purchasers. Is this better or worse than a fixed price situation? Different sets of assumptions can yield different answers to this question.
<h4>Readings</h4>
Klemperer, <Q>What really matters in auction design</Q> OnCourse
<br>Ozment, <q>Bug Auctions: Vulnerability Markets Reconsidered </Q>
<h4>Optional Readings</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">Apr 13 Session 4: Valuing Patching and Disclosure</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
This paper is both about the importance of patching and vulnerabilites, and an excellent example of how to construct an experiment. The honey pots were set up with clear questions and goals in mind; the data compiled was appropriate; and the results are clear. We will spend some time discussing the construction of experiments.

 <h2>Student Work, Student Selected Readings, Works in Progress</h2>
Based on student choices about their grading, these sections may include presentations of student work in the class. Alternatively, students will define the interests and we will look at those papers. By this time in the semester the 2006 Workshop on Economics of Information Security will be organized, and there will be interesting works in that as well.
