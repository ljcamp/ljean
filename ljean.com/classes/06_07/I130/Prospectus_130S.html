<div class="noteBox">Introduction</div class="noteBox">
Introduction to Cybersecurity is designed to provide undergraduate students with a 10,000 ft overview of both cybersecurity as a concept and an area of study. The course will provide an opportunity to hear not only the faculty but also the professionals who protect the Indiana University network. Participation does not require understanding more than the lecture; as there are no technical requirements for taking the course. The course is ideal for those students who are enrolled in Informatics or Computer Science; but it is also extremely accessible to those who are simply curious as to the risks they face on the network. The material will be targeted at a level appropriate for freshman, and clarifying questions are more than welcome.

<table width ="80%" summary="Grading Percentages" border="0" align="center">

	<tr>
		<td>  40%</td>
		<td> class participation</td>
		<td width = "50%">in class and on on-course participation are both counted.</td>

</p>
In terms of  participation both in the classroom and in the discussion area in On-Course are considered. If you are more comfortable speaking than writing, or more comfortable writing as opposed to  speaking, you may choose only one. Participation should illustrate that any assigned reading has been complete, or when there are no readings that the course presentation was carefully watched. Participation that is not professional in manner will not be counted as a positive contribution. To be clear, any student who dimishes the contributions of less advanced students will find his or her own grade suffers.  
<br>
<br>
In terms of the weekly writing, each week there is a 300 word commentary on the lecture. The commentary may be a summary, or a comment, or you may ask a question, or you may connect the lecture to some current event.  The commentary must illustrate awareness (to be passable) and understanding (to be excellent) of the lecture materials.

This course introduces students to Security.  The course will primarily focus on introduction to three core areas (technical aspects of security, organizational aspects of security and legal aspects of security).  Through examples of security problems in real life, this  course will illuminate fundamental  ideas and concepts of information security.

Wear sunscreen.

<h4>March 20: Pharming and Overview</h4> 
<center><em>
Alex Tsow, Visiting Research Associate, Informatics
</center></em>
You rely upon the domain name system to connect to the site you you are seeking. This is increasingly becoming a gamble, rather than a reasonable choice.

<h4>March 27: Cryptography</h4> 
<center><em>
Steve Myers, Assistant Professor, Informatics.
</center></em>
The mastery of mathematics meant millions of lives saved in WW II. Today it means billions of dollars in Internet commerce. 

<h4>April 3: Security in Practice: Mechanism Design</h4>
<center><em>
Xiaofeng Wang, Assistant Professor, Informatics.
</center></em>
Protocols define the syntax and semantics of communication between devices. That is security protocols can be seen as games. Understanding security means understanding the rules and breaking security allows you to cheat. 

<h4>April 10: Phishing</h4> 
<center><em>
Markus Jakobsson, Associate Professor, Informatics and Computer Science.
</center></em>
In phishing the bait is electronic and you are the target. How can you avoid getting hooked?

<h4>April 17: Ubiquitous Security</h4> 
<center><em> 
Professor Kay Connelly, Associate Professor, Computer Science.
</center></em>
As computers become as ubiquitous as lighting, can privacy be maintained?

<h4>April 24: Social Informatics of Security </h4> 
<center><em>
Jean Camp, Associate Professor of Informatics <br>

</center></em>
Security is based on social concepts of identity, trust, and the nature of a transaction.
