<div class="noteBox">Introduction</div class="noteBox">
Introduction to Cybersecurity is designed to provide undergraduate students with a 10,000 ft overview of both cybersecurity as a concept and an area of study. The course will provide an opportunity to hear not only the faculty but also the professionals who protect the Indiana University network. Participation does not require understanding more than the lecture; as there are no technical requirements for taking the course. The course is ideal for those students who are enrolled in Informatics or Computer Science; but it is also extremely accessible to those who are simply curious as to the risks they face on the network. The material will be targeted at a level appropriate for freshman, and clarifying questions are more than welcome.

	<tr>
		<td>  40%</td>

</p>
In terms of  participation both in the classroom and in the discussion area in On-Course are considered. If you are more comfortable speaking than writing, or more comfortable tin writing than speaking, you may choose only one. Participation should illustrate that any assigned reading has been complete. Participation that is not professional in manner will not be counted as a positive contribution.
<br>
<br>
In terms of the weekly writing, each week there is a 150 word commentary on the lecture. The commentary may be a summary, or a comment, or you may ask a question, or you may connect the lecture to some current event.  The commentary must illustrate awareness (to be passable) and understanding (to be excellent) of the lecture materials.

This course introduces students to Security.  The course will primarily focus on introduction to three core areas (technical aspects of security, organizational aspects of security and legal aspects of security).  Through examples of security problems in real life, this  course will illuminate fundamental  ideas and concepts of information security.

<h4>October 25: The Course in a Nutshell</h4> 
<center><em>
Professor <a href="http://www.ljean.com/">Jean Camp</a> 
</center></em>

Introduction to the basic concepts of security. Introduction to the faculty, grading and class organization. 
</center></em>

<h4>November 1: Your Privacy and Security</h4> 
<center><em>
Bob Konicek, Network Administrator
</center></em>
As you use the computers and networks in Informatics, what does the school learn about you? Does this align with your expectations?

<h4>November 8:  Security Protocols</h4> 
<center><em>
Markus Jakobsson, Associate Professor, Informatics and Computer Science.
</center></em>
Protocols define the syntax and semantics of communication between devices. That is security protocols can be seen as games. Understanding security means understanding the rules and breaking security allows you to cheat. 

<h4>November 15: Security in Practice</h4>
<center><em>
Mark Bruhn, Chief IT Security and Policy Officer, IU.
</center></em>
Security in theory is different from in practice. What does it mean to secure a network? How do network managers view security, and what are the real-world threats likely to be faced by security managers.

<h4>November 29: Malware on the Network</h4> 
<center><em>
Raquel Hill,  Assistant  Professor, Informatics and Computer Science.
</center></em>
Connectivity is exposure. Network risks include denial of service, masquerade attacks, and directing hacking assaults. This session will focus on understanding the threats created on and in the network. 

<h4>December 6: Malware in Peer to Peer Networks</h4> 
<center><em>
Minaxi Gupta, Assistant Professor of Computer Science.
</center></em>
Security is based on concepts of transactions, log-in and specified roles. P2P can violate  all those assumptions. What risk are you taking when you download your music.
