<h4>Introduction and Course Overview</h4></center>
<div class="noteBox"> August 28</div class="noteBox">
The first day is for introductions, overviews and expectations.
<br>
<br>
<br><h4>Topic 1: Fundamentals of Security as Social Informatics</h4></center>
Social Informatics of Security  is a case-based course on privacy and security in social contexts. Privacy and security technologies can diverge from their designers. Privacy-enhancing technologies have been used to defeat data protection legislation, and cryptographic technologies of freedom can be used by corrupt regimes to protect their records from external view.  This overview will take at most two sessions.
<br>

What is privacy?
<br>You are supposed to read THE DISSENT. The entire document is readable, <A href=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/printer_friendly.pl?page=us/216/386.html> the famed Olmstead Dissent</a>.
<br>Warren and Brandies available on <A href="https://oncourse.iu.edu/portal">On-Course</a>.  Warren, Samuel D. and Brandeis, Louis D., The Right to Privacy, Harvard Law Review, Vol. IV, No. 5, Dec. 15, 1890, pp 193-220.
<br>
In this discussion of privacy the authors make two interesting claims. First, that the application of the concept of privacy should be technology-neutral. Second, that the technologies themselves demand responses. These articles provide a nice framework for Topics 2 and 3. 
<br>
<br>
<div class="noteBox">September 4</div class="noteBox">
Having spent time discussing the early classic defenses of privacy, let us look at modern privacy. As journalists were the bane of Brandeis, bloggers today are the source of similar privacy issues. There are not classical writings on blogging v privacy. So here are links to cases that we will discuss in class. 
<br>
<br>Here are the perspectives of <A href=http://www.jewsonfirst.org/06b/indianriver.html> Jews on First</a> and <a href=http://www.stoptheaclu.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=54&Itemid=2>the Stop the ACLU</a> posting of plaintiff's names. 
<br>
<br>Milking Against Students Against War. Student protesters found that their contact information was posted on Malkin's blog. See the articles <A href=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2006/April/22/local/stories/02local.htm>http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2006/April/22/local/stories/02local.htm</a>, here <A href=http://michellemalkin.com/archives/004974.htm> Malkin Posts Information twice</a>, <A href=http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2006/04/future_imperfec.html> discussion from the punditry, <A href=http://saw.revolt.org/node/51> an argument on SAWs site</a> and finally, <A href=http://www.alternet.org/mediaculture/35381/>arguments that posting her contact information was or was not acceptable.</a>
<br>
<br>Now that was unfiltered discussion, including some randomness, rhetorical fallacies, and a bit of populist garbage. To make this a worthwhile discussion consider blogging as an amplifying technology. Just as lithography, the penny press, dime novels, and pamphlets created the first level of concern over privacy, blogging technology creates another. When everyone is a journalist, is everyone a public figure? If you post on the net are you a public figure? And what role does anonymity play in blogging?
<br>
<br>Now read this article about the cost of anonymity <A href=citeseer.ist.psu.edu/friedman98social.html>The Social Cost of Cheap Nyms</a>. How does this apply? Does it apply?

<br>Nissenbaum: Security as computer security and security as national security.
<br>Now there is a shared concept of privacy and security. The conflicts between privacy and security will be a major theme continuing in this class. This article provides two very different concepts of security, particularly as security relates to privacy.

<br><br>
<h4>Topic 2: Technological Determinism</h4></center>
The last three sessions we have looked at two sets of technical change - one from the past century and one from the past decade.  Do technologies <q>cause</q> social change or does social change <q>drive</q> technology? We are going to discuss that first in the case of the printing press - certainly an information revolution - and then in a situation where technology arguably drove policy.

The telephone was invented by Ma Bell so we could reach out and touch someone. Today the phone is a toy, a camera, an accessory and also a tracking device. This is not how it was initially conceptualized.

<br><br>
<div class="noteBox">September 20</div class="noteBox">
In the general and in the specific case of privacy, we have question how society is influenced by technology, and how technology influences society. Some theory with an emphasis on historical cases of information technologies (e.g., the telephone and the printing press) has hopefully proved useful.  
When code is law, and when law defines code are or are not exceptions. Code, and societal responses, social belief systems, and uses of technology are complex interactions, not unidirectional forces. Finally, this frames the issue of accountability when designing or purchasing information and communications technologies.

<h4>Topic 3: Social and Technical Concepts of Trust</h4></center>
Not only could the competing concepts of trust be a course in itself; but also entire courses have been built around each of these discrete concepts. Marketing, psychology, computer security, social theory and organizational theory all have different concepts of trust. We review these competing concepts, and use this session to evaluate security technologies.

<h4> Topic 4: The techno-Social Construction of Identity</h4></center>
<q>Identity theft</q> is a particularly interesting name for a type source of fraud that, ironically, takes  advantage of social distance and the lack of identities in electronic contexts. 
Identity theft, and phishing, are considered online crimes while the most significant portion occurs through the mails
 and phone systems. Identity construction as social and organizational are discussed during these session. 
Two of the cases considered here, X.509 and PGP,  have been well examined. Identity management systems make assumptions about a fundamental question: who are we? Role-based systems, federated identity systems, and centralized systems implement different views of identity, authentication and trust. Agency and contracts are discussed. Examples rich with rhetoric are stripped to the essential forces at play.
