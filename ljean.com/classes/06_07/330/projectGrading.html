<h3>Participation</h3>
You cannot make an A in a class you do not attend. Participation includes attending. Participation also includes either speaking in class or being an active participant in on-line discussion. 
<h3>Weekly Memos</h3>
Each week, excluding the two weeks when students groups are presenting, will be graded subject to the guidelines provided on OnCourse. 
<h3>Presentation Grading</h3>
<p>
You are presenting yourself as well as the project. Your title page should include the names and emails of all participants. The presentation should have a single outline not three sub-outlines. Represent yourself well, and consider this as part of your education as a professional. 
 The content you are presenting obviously matters: address all the critical dimensions. Flow, coherence, and timing matter. 
</p>
<h3>Project Grading</h3>
<h4>Written Project</h4>
The expected length is between a minimum of 7,500 words and a maximum of 10,000. For groups of four, the project will be between 10,000 and 12,500.
<p>
The paper will be on the approved topic but need not strictly conform to the approved outline. 
<p>
The paper will be graded on the following:
<p>
1. a concise statement of the particular problem being examined
<p>The initial problem statement should be in the introduction and not exceed a paragraph. The description of the problem in the work will be more detailed and should correspond. 

<p>
2. a clear description of the interplay between the technology, the law, the economics and business
<p>The description should be understandable to any person who has completed the underclass Informatics syllabus.
<p>
3. use of references
<p>Understanding what should be referenced and what can be made as a general knowledge statement. Correct integration of references and parentheticals. 
<p>
4. logical support of conclusions
<p>The conclusion should follow from the problem description and the method. No new techniques or arguments should be introduced in the conclusions section. 
<p>
5. clarity of exposition
<p>Proofread, spell check, be consistent with your formatting, and make certain that all material printed. I have posted writing guidelines. 
<p>
<h4>Work Plan </h4>
The work plan will lay out the timetable of the project and the individual responsibilities. You will need to break up the project along reasonable dimensions - temporal, topical, or spatial. For example, you may be doing the stages of file sharing software: pre-Napster, Napster to Kazaa, and the future. You  may be comparing  the technical, business, and legal choices in deciding to implement PeopleSoft. You may examine open source in three nations, and give each person one country to research. <p> 


<h4>Bibliography </h4>
The bibliography ensures that you are on the right track, and  that no major gaps are in your project. It is the basis for the referencing grade for the written element of the project.
