<h2>The Course in a Nutshell</h2> 
<div class="noteBox">January 8</div>
<h4>Introduction and course overview</h4>
Today we handle who, when, and why. We will introduce ourselves. I will
define course policies. I will provide information about the project,
about grade distribution, etc. <br>
This course is about ICTs, organizations and the role of security in organizations. The course has three primary elements. 
<br> 
First, the readings and lectures where the minimum critical topics
for literacy in organizations and information security are introduced. The readings
and lectures will focus primarily on theory, particularly looking at
organizations through the lens of economics. 
<br> 
Second, the discussion section. There will be some readings
during the discussion section, primarily those that apply to the
practical training part of the course. 
<br> 
Third is the practical training. The project is an experience in
team management. It includes writing a workplan, implementing the work
plan, and filling out an evaluation of your peers. Most of you are
attending this University to broaden your horizons and increase your
employment-relevant skills. This project, properly executed, will do
both. At the end of the project you should have a considerably expanded
knowledge of your subject, improved presentation skills, and an
extremely cursory introduction to project management. Regular deadlines
during the semester are intended to force the groups not to wait until
the last moment to complete the project.

<h2>Introduction to Organizations</h2> 
An organization can be considered a
single entity, a collection of competing subsets, a group of
self-optimizing individuals, a machine following a process, or a
cultural entity. In the first section of this course we will examine
each of those models. 
For three of the models the reading will be <q>Essence of Decision</q>.
This book is about the interaction of nation states rather than the
interactions of businesses. However, in terms of the descriptions of
three of these models there is no other reading that is short but
informative. There are more tedious readings, and readings made terse
by assumptions of the education of the reader. Therefore, the classic
by Allison will be used to discuss the issues. I will provide a very
short introduction to rational choices, and then examine the limits of
rationality. We return to the limits of rationality topic in Economics
and Uncertainty.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">January 31 Organizations as Single Rational Beings</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>There are three models of
organizations: individual rational actors, collections of groups or
stakeholders, and as groups of political individuals with their own
visions and power struggles. <h4>Readings</h4>
<br>Allison "Essence of Decision", The Rational Actor, pp. 13 26. 
<br>Tversky and Kahneman, "Rational Choice and the Framing of Decisions" in Rational Choice, Hogarth and Reder, eds., pp. 67-94.

<br><p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="noteBox">February 5 Organizations as Compilation of Stakeholders</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>Organizations are not
always entirely rational. Ironically, the rational organization
understands itself as being created by a group of components, and tries
to construct mechanisms to create effective interactions between the
components. Understanding the components of the organization can
prevent the creation of perverse incentives. <h4> Reading</h4>
<br>Allison, <q>Essence of Decision</q>, Model II: Organizational Behavior, pp. 143-160.

<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>

<h4> Reading</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>Organizational Models Continued</h2> More conceptual models of
organizations. Each of these applies to most organizations in
difference decision contexts. Determining the context of a debate can
help you win internal debates.

<div class="noteBox">February 21 Organizations as Policy Constructs</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>From where do
organizations come? Is it just the cooperation of a many
people? Economic forces? Group psychology? Indeed, businesses are
presented in media and academy as distinct and clear opposites from
government. Yet in
fact their interaction is quite deep and profound. Government plays a
critical role in creating markets and businesses just as the
environment plays a critical role in creating ecosystems and species.

market. 

<div class="noteBox">April 4 Lock-In</div>

<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Network economics implies feedback. Feedback can cause lock-in. How easy will it be for you to get a new email? A new phone?
Here is the first paper that begins to take a formal economic approach to the question of economics of security. For many years before this, the question of economics as an externality was widely asserted but never formally illustrated. This is a transitional paper to the more formal work following.
