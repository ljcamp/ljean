<div class="presentBox">An Acceptable Memo</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Thank you for participating in the Organizational Informatics course. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
One element of the grade for this course is the preparation of weekly memos. Each memo must be based on one course reading for the previous week. That reading should be in the "subject" field of the memo. The memo is "To" the appropriate AI. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
An acceptable memo will include a topic that is clearly identified in the reading, and  address the context within the reading. For example, when discussing network effects a memo that discusses telecommunications networks without discussing the economic concepts of networks is unacceptable.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Arguments in opposition to the presumptions in the readings are acceptable. However, making an informed argument is necessary. For example, to argue against proven concepts of risk perception you must find AT LEAST multiple media sources to support your position. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Life experiences and anecdotes are not an adequate basis for an argument against a theory presented in the reading.  An argument  may use a personal experience to enhance a thesis, but it cannot be the basis of an argument or a memo. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Memos must be spell-checked. The grammar in the memos must be correct. The memo must be presentable, in a reasonable format, readable,  and without evidence of folding or staining. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Any incidence of plagiarism in a memo will cause the student committing this act of academic dishonor to be failed, with the appropriate notation on the transcript. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
No memo will be accepted late unless there is a documented medical reason.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The memos are graded from 1-5 and each memo will in fact count from 0.2 to 1.0 points in the final grade, based on the grading. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Grades will be posted within ten business days after memos are due. After that, you have  ten business days to note a missing grade or object to your grade. After that time, the grade for your memo is final. To object to a grade on a memo prepare a written objection, provide the original memo as graded, and I will evaluate your written objection with the appropriate AI.  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Thank you again for participating in this course. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
best regards,<br>
Jean Camp
