<div class="presentBox"><b>MEMO ON GROUP FORMATION</b> </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br>   TO: (readers' names - in this case Professor Camp and Instructor Carter)
<br>    FROM: (your name and cognates - usually job titles instead of cognate)
<br>    DATE: (complete and current date)
<br>   SUBJECT: (what the memo is about, highlighted in some way)
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Begin with a statement of subject, e.g.,  <q>This memo is to inform you that  we (I) have (have not) formed a project group.</q>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="notebox">FOR THOSE IN GROUPS:</div>
List the following: <br>
 <br>Project title or proposed subject (Subject may be undetermined. Please note is that is the case.) 
 <br>Full contact information as follows
 <br> Team member name & contact (email, phone, cell phone, address) 
 <br> Team member  name & contact (email, phone, cell phone, address) 
 <br> Team member  name & contact (email, phone, cell phone, address) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The memo should include additional information about group formation. This may include  reasons for the choice of group members, such as relative strengths or shared interests. This information will allow us to better evaluate your progress along the way. For example, three business cognates  or three telecommunications majors working on economics would require very different reading materials. Similarly, three computer science majors or three telecommunications majors examining music sharing should have two very different bibliographies and projects. 
The first paragraph following the contact information will describe the project. This may be somewhat indeterminate, as you have not as yet done any research. The following paragraphs will describe what strengths each of you bring to the issue at hand. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The final paragraph will include a date and time of your next two meetings with the goals of those  meeting. A first  goal may be topic selection, or location of resources.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="notebox">FOR THOSE WITHOUT GROUPS:</div>
 <br>Provide the following:
 <br> Personal contact (email, phone, cell phone, address) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The subject should include at least 100 word on your strengths, skills and interests as well as at least five possible topics of interest.  These should be different paragraphs. The topics may be presented as bullet points. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
If  you do not have a group you should list at least three times in the following week that you are available. We will share the memos with the newly-formed groups.  This will allow you to meet soon with the least organizational overhead. These times are your action item, and should close the memo. If there are not overlapping times in the memos it is each members' responsibility to contact the other two to select a subject and move forward. It is NOT the responsibility of either instructor to organize meeting times for you. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
If you do not have a group the most you can earn on this memo is three points.  Your group will then have to complete this memo, on group formation, and attach it to the bibliography. You will NOT earn the additional points at that time; however, failure to produce the memo will result in complete loss of any of the initial three points and your bibliography will not receive full marks.    I cannot evaluate a bibliography without having information about who is supposed to be doing the reading. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Similarly if you do not provide the initial memo on time, later provision with the bibliography will not add to  your project formation grade. Later provision will simply allow the bibliography to receive full marks. <p>&nbsp;</p>
