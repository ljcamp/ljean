Introduction and Overview</div>

In the initial class meeting we step through the syllabus. I answer any grading queries. I describe assignments, standards and options. For the first week  you have two very light assignments: a quiz and your first essay. For the quiz, I ask that you write down what particularly interest you in the topic. Are you more interested in the methods or the findings? Is your heart in HCI or are you the soul of business? What level of mathematical discussion is appropriate for the course? The lectures will be designed to serve the needs of the students, and based on your answers the syllabus may also change.

<h4>Questions to consider during  Reading</h4>
What would be your ideal outcome for this course? What do you hope to learn? What topic is missing, is too lightly covered, or is too heavily considered in the following readings?

Computer Security and Privacy in Economics </div>
<h4>Questions to consider during  Reading</h4>
These papers will introduce the basic idea of security as a good. One argues that security is a public good, the other that insecurity has externalities. Most of the vocabulary will be defined in this session.

No Course Meeting</div>
Labor Day is celelbrations of people who work for a living, as opposed to those with so much wealth that there is no need to labor. The first labor day was established by a parade in New York by the unions in 1882, five years before Haymarket and nineteen years before the Triangle Shirtwaist fire.

Basic Reading</div>
<div class="sideBox">General topic and method due Sept 9</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during  Reading</h4>
Notice that the answer to the question &quot;Why information security is hard?&quot; is not because mathematics is sublime. Rather, the work on the fundamentals continues in a scientific (but unpredictable) manner, while adoption of basic solutions occurs in fits, booms, or not at all.

<div class="noteBox">Sept. 12
Card Fraud</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during  Reading</h4>
<br>The reason that there is economics of security is because there are violations of security based on economics, e.g. crime. These papers address the economics of crime, the incentives and the nature of the proverbial beast. Are these numbers what you expect? Credit card number prices appear to be going down. Think about two opposite reasons why this might be the case.

Economic Behavior</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during  Reading</h4>
Why are we willing to take the risks that we take? What makes us unwilling to pay $1 for something one moment that will be worth ten times that in another? Is it true that <q>He who hesitates is lost?</q> or is it critical to loop before one leaps? Humans are not rational when it comes to risk -- economic or networked.

Uncertainty and Sharing Vulnerability Information </div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Why do firms share information that could be embarrassing about their
security state? There are obvious costs, but even when some firms lie,
there are obvious benefits. 
What dimensions of uncertainty exist in vulnerabilities? What strategies do different organizations, both software producers and consumers, apply to deal with these uncertainties?

<h4>Questions to consider during  Reading</h4>

If privacy is a luxury good, what would that imply about the averaging of costs for price discrimination goods?
