<h2>The Course in a Nutshell</h2> 
<div class="noteBox">January 9</div>
<h4>Introduction and course overview</h4>
Today we handle who, when, and why. We will introduce ourselves. I will
define course policies. I will provide information about the project,
about grade distribution, etc. <br>
This course is about ICTs, organizations and the role of security in organizations. The course has three primary elements. 
<br> 
First, the readings and lectures where the minimum critical topics
for literacy in organizations and information security are introduced. The readings
and lectures will focus primarily on theory, particularly looking at
organizations through the lens of economics. 
<br> 
Second, the discussion section. There will be some readings
during the discussion section, primarily those that apply to the
practical training part of the course. 
<br>
Third, the three examinations in the course. The first is on
organizational theory. The second is on economics of information. The
third is on organizational and economic aspects of
organizations. There is no comprehensive final.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Introduction to Organizations</h2> 
An organization can be considered a
single entity, a collection of competing subsets, a group of
self-optimizing individuals, a machine following a process, or a
cultural entity. In the first section of this course we will examine
each of those models. 
For three of the models the reading will be <q>Essence of Decision</q>.
This book is about the interaction of nation states rather than the
interactions of businesses. However, in terms of the descriptions of
three of these models there is no other reading that is short but
informative. There are more tedious readings, and readings made terse
by assumptions of the education of the reader. Therefore, the classic
by Allison will be used to discuss the issues. I will provide a very
short introduction to rational choices, and then examine the limits of
rationality. We return to the limits of rationality topic in Economics
and Uncertainty.

<h2>What are Organizations</h2>

<div class="sideBox">Jan 11: Org Theory.</div>
<div class="noteBox">Organizational Models? </div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
What are organizations: individual rational actors, collections of groups or
stakeholders, and as groups of political individuals with their own
visions and power struggles. Shafritz offers a larger view. What is an
organization? To what organizations do you belong? If you were to
design an web site for two organizations to which you belong what
would be public, and what private? How much would identity management
matter at a fraternity web site versus a departmental one? How would
privacy concerns differ?
<h4>Readings</h4>
Classics of Organization Theory, (6th Edition) by Jay M. Shafritz, Steven Ott, and Yong
Suk Jang; pp 1- 26.

<div class="sideBox">Jan 16: Org Theory.</div>
<div class="noteBox">Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day</div>
Until 1964, single rational organizations seeking employees listed them in four
categories: white man wanted, black man wanted, white woman wanted and
black woman wanted. Listing by race was prohited by the 1964 Civil
Rights Act. By 1971, listing jobs by gender was judged to be
prohibited as well. <a href="http://www.ljean.com/images/HelpWantedGender.jpg">Here is one
job listing</a> and <a href="http://www.ljean.com/images/HelpWantedGender2.jpg"> another</a>.   Notice in the first that typing was a <q>female</q>
task, and notice that Bell was hiring women as Telephone
Operators. The operation of switches became <q>technical</q> and then
male. Similarly until compilers (invented by Grace Murray Hopper)
vastly simplified the process of implementing programs, programming
was overwhelming a <A href="http:eniacprogrammers.org/"> female occupation.</a>

<div class="sideBox">Jan. 18: Org Theory.</div>
<div class="noteBox"> Organizations as Single Rational Beings or
  Compilations of Competing Stakeholders</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>There are three models of
organizations: individual rational actors, collections of groups or
stakeholders, and as groups of political individuals with their own
visions and power struggles. <h4>Readings</h4>

<div class="sideBox">Jan 23: Org Theory.</div>
<div class="noteBox"> Organizations as Cultures or Organizations as Machines</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>Americans spend most of
their waking hours are work. Workplaces are not neutral or free from
emotion. Workplaces have their own cultures, some of which are
successfully cultured by management.

<div class="sideBox">Jan. 25: Org Theory.</div>
<div class="noteBox"> Organizational Impact </div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Why is IT important in an organization? Are ICTS inherently valuable?
If not, how do ICTs illustrate their value. Unlike classic
organization theory classes, this one examines organizations and their
inteaction with ICTs. Does IT matter or is it all a matter of lobbying
and leadership?

<div class="sideBox">Feb. 1: Case Studies</div>
<div class="noteBox">Naming, Risk and Culture</div>
<h4>Questions to consider during reading</h4>
Naming and trust are traditionally bound online in a manner that makes 
sense offline. If I know you by name offline I am likely to have a 
context; e.g. a social organization or neighborhood or religious 
community. However, a name online does not provide the same level of 
certainty. What is in a name? A rose by any other name, in theory, would
 smell as sweet. However, hazelnuts are considered somewhat gourmet 
while filberts were strictly for the common palette. While dried plums 
could be desirable, prunes have no such connotation.

The organization is the environment and, according to an early reading, the environment determines design. What kinds of controls are to be expected in different domains?

What are the risks of failues for each?
