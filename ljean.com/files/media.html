Abstract</h2>
<p>
<p>
Much of the debate about the Internet has focused on the classification of 
various services into traditional media types.  There has been particular 
focus on Usenet, bulletin boards and the World Wide Web.  We argue that 
there is no consensus on the appropriate media classification because no 
one media type accurately characterizes all aspects of Internet 
communications.  The technology of the Internet has confused legal 
theorists into attempting to inappropriately apply those rules set for 
machine-assisted communication despite the fact that the machine no 
longer defines the characteristics of the communication. We will 
illustrate this first by showing how Web and Usenet services fit equally 
well, and equally badly, in each media type.<p>
<p>
We argue the dominance of the media types framework in the debate over 
electronic forums and services has in some cases created threats both to 
speech and to minimal responsible controls.  A more appropriate analog 
than different media is different spaces.   Using events at Carnegie Mellon 
University, Santa Rosa Junior College, and the University of Michigan, we 
will show in more detail how the attempts to fit media types to Internet 
services has created incentives which neither create protected spaces nor 
encourage open debate.  We then use these cases to show how the proposal 
to treat virtual spaces as their physical counterparts would better serve 
both the institutions and the individuals.<p>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
<p>
Determining the First Amendment rights, institutional responsibility and 
institutional perspective using the model of four media is not feasible in 
the new electronic media.     Media classifications are failing in many 
open
networks.  For example, cellular technology  is undeniably broadcast 
technology, yet it fits (appropriately) under the regulatory rubric of wired 
telephony.  Defining First Amendment rights in electronic forums is 
critical to preserving them (Pool 1983).  <p>
<p>
There has been debate over the question of whether network services fall 
under the rubric of broadcast, publisher, distributor, common carrier or 
some yet undetermined media type (Beall 1987, Becer 1989, Di Lello 1992, 
Sassan 1992, Berman 1995, Krattenmaker and Powe 1995).   Every media 
classification has an argument for and against it.  The efforts to find a 
single media classification, or invent one, are doomed to failure because 
the provision of a bboard can be done as a publisher, a distributor, a 
broadcaster or a common carrier.  The differences between bboards or 
newsgroups are much too subtle to be contained in a four way or even five 
way media classification.  The differences are sufficiently subtle that 
rather than a single media type or single space (Naughton 1992), the only 
appropriate model for cyberspace is that of multiple varied physical 
spaces.  There is no such thing as cyberspace, but there are many 
cyberspaces.<p>
<p>
Electronic spaces are as varied as physical spaces.  Previously the 
responsibilities of the producers and distributors of speech were 
determined by the medium of transmission: printed paper, over the air 
broadcast, or closed private circuit (as in telephony).  However, the 
classification of speech by media type is inadequate on the Internet.  
Instead, system configuration, tradition, applications in use, and purpose 
determine the types of spaces that are created on a common medium.   <p>
<p>
We will show how the media model is ill-suited to the Internet by 
illustrating how different actions on Usenet news  and the Web are 
broadcast, distributing, publishing and common carriage.  We will further 
describe how the bboards at Carnegie Mellon University all serve different 
purposes which are analogous to different spaces: bedrooms, classrooms, 
club meetings, departmental conference rooms, and public spaces. Finally 
we will consider three cases where the space analogy may have worked, 
but the media analogy did not.<p>
<h2>
Media Types
</h2>
<p>
The differences in  traditional media types are based on the inherent 
technological capabilities to control content and distribution. With 
Internet services, the classification depends on the configuration and use 
of the service, not the inherent technological capabilities. In this section 
we will show how Usenet news and web services do and no not fit into 
traditional media types. <p>
<h3>
Usenet News &amp; Web Pages as Broadcasts
</h3>
<p>
Broadcasters are under particularly stringent regulation for two reasons: 
the natural scarcity of bandwidth and the lack of filtering mechanisms for 
viewers.<p>
<p>
Broadcasters have an inherent capability to control what they broadcast.  
The facilities for distributing broadcast information are concentrated, 
and the person or institution that controls those facilities can exercise 
absolute control over the distribution.  Because of the nature of 
broadcasting, the decision to broadcast one stream of information 
prohibits anyone else in the service area from using the same spectrum to 
broadcast any information.  Thus broadcasters both select what they will 
broadcast and prevent others from broadcasting different information.<p>
<p>
With  broadcast transmissions, there is no way to prevent someone in the
broadcast area from receiving the information.  Thus broadcasters have no 
control over distribution.<p>
<p>
Usenet news posts and html documents are like broadcast in that they 
enable the transmission of information to large numbers of people.  Once 
on Usenet or on the Web, the information may be downloaded by any of the 
millions of subscribers, thereby becoming inaccessible even to cancelbots.  
Because of the ease of secondary distribution of electronic information, 
once information has been sent over the network or placed in a publicly 
accessible forum it is nearly impossible to prevent widespread  
distribution.<p>
<p>
Usenet news posts and html documents are like broadcast because the 
information comes directly into the home,  and it may be impossible to 
retrieve or destroy the information after it has been broadcast.   
According to one advocate of the Communications Decency Act, it was 
exactly these broadcast characteristics that enabled the regulation to 
pass.   Dee Jepsen of Enough is Enough described the need for the 
Communications Decency Act as follows: "hard-core, child pornography and  
"indecent" material, which is harmful to minors, are being transmitted  
over the Internet directly into our homes " (Jepsen 1995).<p> <p>
Like broadcast, accessing much of the information in Usenet groups and 
most information on the Web requires little technical expertise.   On the 
Web one need only know how to use a mouse to find questionable 
material.<p>
<p>
Providers of Web and Usenet services are unlike broadcast systems in that 
they are not constrained by a natural scarcity of bandwidth. Maintaining or 
providing access to an information service does not prevent others from 
doing so. Also unlike broadcasters, there is a level of technical 
sophistication required to obtain some types of information (such as 
downloading images) available on Usenet.<p>
<p>
Providers of Usenet services are unlike broadcasters in that the 
information is organized and can be searched on a high level.  Newsgroups 
are in named hierarchies, which users can choose to explore, or not.  Thus 
the sudden appearance of explicit images is extremely unlikely.  With 
information on a newsgroup users can choose to look into the newsgroup 
or not.  The Usenet hierarchy is completely unenforceable, but is self-
sustaining through the practices of publicly ignoring and privately flaming 
inappropriate posters, as well as the judicious use of cancelbots.<p>
<p>
With the Web badly named links and misdirection can cause a user of 
information services to be confronted with unwanted information, or may 
allow a user to stumble unintentionally onto offensive imagery.<p>
<p>
Usenet service providers may arguably provide one broadcasting 
capability:  the creation of groups.   There is some information seen by 
every user of Usenet: the names of the groups.  The creation of  Usenet 
discussion groups is initiated by a create group command.  Organizations 
where users can issue create group commands at will serve as 
broadcasters because the information goes into every feed, and the user 
need not actively choose to investigate to encounter the name.  However, 
it is notable that the names of Usenet groups are necessarily text, which 
makes the use of group creation abilities to broadcast images arguably 
impossible.  Thus the sudden appearance of explicit images is not enabled 
by the creation of groups.<p>
<p>
One example of a group name is "alt.Barney.die.die.die."  Certainly there is 
nothing wrong with poking fun at a children's show.  However the simple 
fact that the knowledge of this  group was extremely common, although 
few would search for "Barney" or "die" illustrates the broadcast 
characteristics of newsgroup titles. Note that groups have respected the 
desires of others in keeping names modest, for example, the  discussion 
group for gay men is soc.motss, (meaning members of the same sex), and 
virulent racists tend to misc.activism.militia.<p>
<p>
The attempt to regulate the Internet as a broadcast medium through the 
Communications Decency Act has failed.  The regulation of the Internet as 
a
broadcast medium has been found to be unconstitutional, and thus is not an 
option (Stets 1996, American Library Association Inc. v United States).<p>
<h3>
Usenet News &amp; Web Pages as Publishing
</h3>
<p>
Publishers are assumed to have full knowledge of the information they 
present -- as newspapers have editorial control.  Publishers are given 
unique freedom to expose private facts to public scrutiny for the public 
good (Ginger 1975, New York Times v United States, 1971).<p>
<p>
That a provider of information services can be found to be a publisher is 
illustrated in the case  of Prodigy.  Prodigy is a publisher as illustrated by 
the recent court decisions,?.  However, Prodigy was found to be a 
publisher not of Usenet, but of its proprietary newsgroups and possibly 
the posts of its subscribers. Prodigy filtered messages and rejected those 
found to be 
unacceptable for the family environment, which Prodigy targets as its 
market.<p> <p>
Providers of information services are like publishers in that the primary 
goal is to give readers, electronic or physical, access to selected 
information.<p> <p>
All system operators are like publishers in that they cannot reasonably be 
held liable when information they produce is incorrect and leads to bad 
decision making by the receiver (Daniel v Dow Jones).  Providers of Usenet 
services are also similar to publishers in that they have no control over 
secondary dissemination of the materials they provide.<p>
<p>
Providers of Usenet and Web servers are like publishers in that they can 
control the initial distribution of information. Operators of private 
subscriber systems  can choose to restrict their customers to employees or 
those that can provide proof of age; firewalls, IP address and password 
protection is available for Web pages.<p>
<p>
Treating Internet service providers (ISPs) as publishers would result in 
prohibition of vast amounts of information, as suggested by Stratton 
Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Servs.   Such a regulatory regime would require 
that Internet service providers search all posts and approve all pages.  This 
has implications not only for speech rights, but also privacy rights.<p>
<h3>
Usenet News &amp; Web Pages as Distributors
</h3>
<p>
Providers of information services are like distributors in that they have 
the ability to filter at the highest level of content.  That is information 
services providers can select Usenet groups or domains where access is 
allowed, while prohibiting others.   Like publishers, system operators have 
been found not to be liable when information they produce is incorrect and 
leads to bad decision making by the recipient (Daniel v Dow Jones 1987).<p>
<p>
Providers of Internet services are like distributors in that they cannot have 
knowledge of all information that is provided through their service.   Only 
high level filtering is possible for many providers of Internet services. 
Filtering such as provided by Prodigy requires large investments both in 
filtering software, and in labor since each flagged message must be 
evaluated by a human.<p>
<p>
Like distributors, providers of Internet services may have reason to know 
some content. For example, any ISP would know the content of any group 
named *.pedophilia would be unacceptable, and in fact requests to create 
such groups are denied.<p>
<p>
Providers of Internet services are unlike distributors in that a limited
ability to distinguish users means a limited ability to control access.   
The sheer volume of information which flows through a Usenet feed, and 
the amount of information requested by users' clients from various Web 
servers makes detailed filtering extremely difficult.<p>
<p>
CompuServe is a distributor because it provides access to information 
"published" or written by the subscribers, while CompuServe itself does 
not provide content (Cubby v CompuServe Inc., 1991).  CompuServe doesn't 
edit the content in specific posts and forums, but rather chooses which 
forums are allowed.  This is analogous to a bookstore which selects 
specific books but cannot reasonably know what is in every book.<p>
<p>
However, regulating Usenet and Web services as secondary publishers 
creates difficulties.   High level decisions on content mean broad 
prohibitions. Prohibited content may have a particularly valuable 
character for reasons of health.  For example broad prohibition of obscene 
words forced breast cancer survivors on AOL to create a chat group for 
"hooter" cancer survivors, and prevented women from listing themselves 
as breast cancer survivors in their .profiles ( roughly equivalent to .plan 
files).   Arguably, electronic discussions of sex, as takes place on 
alt.sex.wizards and alt.sexual.abuse.recovery are particularly valuable on 
the Internet since there is no threat of violence, and there is potential for 
anonymous or pseudonymous discussion.<p>
<h3>
Usenet &amp; the Web as Common Carriage
</h3>
<p>
Providers of Usenet and Web servers also arguably have characteristics of 
common carriers.   Providers of Internet services provide routing for 
others' packets with nondiscrimination.  Providers of Usenet feeds provide 
the entire feed, with the recipient responsible for filtering.<p>
<p>
Usenet news posts and html documents are like telephone conversations in 
that they are so numerous that knowledge of all content is not possible.<p>
<p>
However, Internet provision of Usenet and Web services is not common 
carriage in that there is no requirement to provide nondiscriminatory 
services to individual users.  ISPs can remove users at will, unlike 
telephone companies. Internet providers can choose whether or not to act 
when a subscriber is sending or receiving harassing or offensive email, 
and an ISP can choose to block certain domains or sites.<p>
<p>
The difficulty with regulating the Internet and Internet service providers 
as though Usenet news and Web services were common carriage is that 
there is no need or right to act.  If Internet services are common carriage 
then an ISP could not remove Internet access privileges for abuse of other 
individuals, or other behavior commonly defined as abuse of the Internet 
itself such as spamming.<p>
<h2>
Internet Common Law
</h2>
<p>
The law is not coming to the Internet, it has always been there.  It has 
never been the case that communicating a death threat to a Federal 
official has been legal if it was communicated through email.  That the 
President is only recently on the Internet means that this law is only 
recently applied -- it does not mean that death threats were ever legal.<p>
<p>
Recent arrivals to the Internet, or newbies, often see the Internet as a 
place of chaos -- actually it is quite orderly.  There are rules of the road 
on the information highway.  The fundamental common law is, "You spam, 
we flame." Spams and cancelpoodles always create responses.  Complaints 
to employers and
ISPs of offenders is common, as well as simple flaming.<p>
<p>
Where an item is posted or how it is linked defines the acceptability of 
the information on the Internet.  Hate posts, which may seem unacceptable 
anywhere, are sometimes flamed for being in the wrong place.  This is 
substantially different than objecting to one's right to speech -- it is an 
objection that the reader's right to ignore such speech  in daily life is 
being violated.<p> <p>
There are vastly different levels of civility, and vastly different signal to 
noise ratios in different areas of the Internet.  Cross-posting does create 
confusion and blurs such lines.  However, some things are certain.  For 
example, alt.peeves will remain forever less civil than 
rec.crafts.textiles.needlework.<p>
<p>
This range of acceptability suggests a recognition: that there is no 
cyberspace, but many cyberspaces.  The attempt to fit all ISPs, or all 
Usenet groups, or all Web pages into a single category will fail just as 
attempts to determine universal laws for speech will fail.   In the next 
section we consider physical spaces, and their electronic analogs.<p>
<h2>
Physical Spaces
</h2>
<p>
One reason denizens of the Internet call it cyberspace is that the various 
attributes applicable to defining different physical spaces can also be 
used to define different virtual spaces.   Note that the physical space of a 
speech has been a defining characteristic of its acceptability; you can 
neither falsely yell "Fire!" in a crowded theater nor expound upon 
philosophies of racial superiority at work.  Yet there are places for both 
outrageous exclamations and offensive arguments in the physical world.  
We argue that the same is true in the virtual world.<p>
<p>
The organization and language of users on the Internet suggest an option: 
parallels of physical space.  Consider how the description of files and 
services currently reflects an awareness of how different services offer 
different types of space: cyberspace, home page, chat room, mail box, 
dungeon, and home directory to name a few.<p>
<p>
The argument that the same constraints apply to electronic newsgroups as 
to physical bboards reflects a recognition that there are different spaces; 
what governs the appropriate use of a physical bulletin board is in no 
small degree its location.  The bulletin board in the grocery store varies 
significantly from the bulletin board in the office.<p>
<p>
Why are cyberspaces more like spaces than media?  First, media assumes 
that the technology determines content control.  Multiple spaces are set 
up using the same fundamental construction technologies and principles.  
Similarly electronic spaces with very different characteristics can be set 
up using the same electronic tools.  <p>
<p>
Secondly media types assume control exists at a single location.  For 
telephony the location is at the end user, for broadcasters it is at the 
originator. With electronic services there can be multiple levels of 
control.  An institution may limit access to an internal Web page, or allow 
it to be open. In either case the author of the Web page may choose to 
provide access to a select group, or to many.<p>
<p>
Thirdly there is limited assurance of speech protection in various media 
types. Obscenity can be outlawed by the states for example; yet raiding a 
home or private poetry reading would be extreme.  Because the equivalent 
spaces on the Internet are not so closed such a raid or prohibition may be 
likely to happen. Authors have advocated protecting cyberspace as a whole 
as an electronic soapbox (Berman, 1996).    The Internet offers a unique 
opportunity for speech -- particularly the speech of the despised or 
threatened.  Individuals can interact with those that support violence 
against groups of to which the individual belongs without fear of personal 
reprisal.  For example, few of the liberals who argue on the militia group 
would go a militia meeting to confront the armed self-proclaimed patriots 
physically.   Physical threat is far less effective at silencing speech when 
the space is virtual and the participants dispersed.  Yet it is precisely 
those dialogues that would be limited by a threatening environment that 
are most likely to be subject to limitation -- areas for hate speech and 
sexual speech provide forums for debates which would otherwise be 
unlikely to occur. Recognizing the value in these debates implies 
protecting them from closure, and assuring providers and participants 
free reign to advocate the most outrageous stands without fear of 
liability.  It also requires protection of speech from other users who 
would silence opponents through cancels.<p>
<p>
Fourth, the space analogy offers an opportunity to declare that there are 
special cases where control must be asserted without requiring complete 
control.   A case where control may be required would be when an ISP is 
being used to stage a malicious attack on other systems, or is sending out 
a collection of perfectly legal but speech-destroying cancelbots.  With 
media types, control in an extreme situation shows evidence of the ability 
to control and therefore of broad liability. <p>
<p>
Finally the space analogy has the advantage that its understanding is 
intuitive.  The social contract that may appear to fail in a workspace may 
be failing simply because it is not understood to be a workplace by all 
parties. Such an understanding would bring to the electronic forum far 
better internalized understanding among users than the application of 
media types. <p> <p>
The chart below shows how different discussion groups at Carnegie Mellon 
University can correspond to different spaces; if forced into the media 
type paradigm, these would need to be in different media types.<p>

<h3>The Fits and Failures of the Space and Media Types Models at Carngeie Mellon</h3> 

<p><p><h2>Bedroom</h2><p>In the bedroom an individual has the right to 
speak and act in most offensive ways that would not be acceptable outside 
the home.   Should a group gather in a bedroom there would be no action 
against speech absent criminal intent.<p> <p>
Law enforcement must have reason to even enter a person's bedroom.  
There must be some evidence of a crime, or a clear and present danger.  
Lewd, obscene and pornographic speech find protection in the home. <p>
<p>
Private distribution lists created for the consensual discussion of adult 
topics may be an example of a bedroom operating on the Internet. Dial-up 
pornography BBSs may be a second example.  A user's personal email can 
serve as a bedroom. <p>
<p>
Not only do citizens have the right to speak freely in our bedrooms we 
have the right to bar ideas from our bedrooms.  Just as technical 
mechanisms have developed to filter material from our desktops and 
mailboxes (Spertus 1996) legal mechanisms have been developed to 
protect our bedrooms.  Speech that has only political implications on the 
street corner, such as the advocacy of violence against a select group, has 
much different implications in terms of politics and present danger when 
reiterated in the bedroom of a member of the targeted group. <p>
<p>
Bedrooms  can provide more freedom of speech than telephones, 
particularly sexual speech.  As gender issues are part of today's most 
hotly contested political debates, determination to prohibit passionate 
speech which as obscenity can strictly limit these debates.  Network 
owners have been allowed to prohibit constitutionally protected speech 
and have refused to enter contracts with those that present undesirable 
viewpoints.  Declaring that some areas are legitimately the proper space 
for undesirable opinions and obscene speech, and that retributions for 
such speech made in the appropriate forums is prohibited, has the 
potential to provide greater freedom of speech than current regulation of 
telephony network owners (Barron, 1993). <p>
<h3>
Workspaces</h3>
<p>
In the workspace, the spirit of respect for others is an important aspect 
of maintaining a professional environment. Depending on the work being 
done there, other values of how colleagues should treat one another will 
prevail; in a corporate environment, there may be expectations for more 
formal speech. In a university, the spirit of inquiring and openness may 
dominate.<p>
<p>
In a university setting, workspaces may include departmental newsgroups, 
and some student groups that maintain a professional environment or that 
students consider to be preparation for their careers, such as a newspaper 
or business organization.<p>
<p>
Speech is controlled in a workspace.  Speech that would be dangerous 
because of implications of physical violence in a bedroom can create the 
danger of economic deprivation if repeated in workspaces, as recognized 
by the EEOC. <p>
<h3>
Classrooms</h3>
<p>
In the classroom, there should be a spirit of inquiry that enables the 
broaching of any subject and the expression of any viewpoint. There should 
also be a spirit of respect for others and a code of behavior that prohibits 
personal attacks and intimidation. An environment that is free from 
harassment and intimidation yet that accords individuals due respect is 
most conducive to the uninhibited sharing of ideas.<p>
<p>
Course discussion newsgroups at universities may function as a classroom 
space. Clarifications of homework, queries and comments between 
students, professors, and teaching assistants sometimes result in terse 
or angry debates.  The advocacy of ethnic cleansing, racist remarks, or 
personal insults each remain as inappropriate or appropriate as in the 
classroom -- depending on the topic at hand.  In the classroom the 
instructor and other students work together to maintain the appropriate 
learning atmosphere by responding to inappropriate behavior.  <p>
<p>
Just as one would be unlikely to come to class in bedclothes, some speech 
appropriate in the bedroom is inappropriate in a classroom.  Conversely, as 
one never need listen to offensive speech in the bedroom one must listen 
to ideas in the classroom.  The purpose of being in a classroom is to 
encounter ideas. Unlike workplaces, the exchange of passionate ideas is an 
ideal in the classroom. <p>
<h3>
The
Town Square
</h3>
<p>
In the town square, free expression is paramount. It is a space designed 
for the exchange of ideas political and personal. Personal attacks, 
outrageous arguments, hate speech, and the like are welcome here. Direct 
criminal threats and slander are the bounds of speech here; propriety is 
not at issue.<p>
<p>
On the Internet, town squares may include groups that wish to create 
dialogue on various issues, such as political organizations.  The entire alt 
hierarchy is a town n-cube, far surpassing the space and time limitations 
imposed on a physical square. <p>
<p>
It is clear that a given entity on a college campus could serve more than 
one purpose. For example, an African-American students' organization 
could be involved with political dialogue, offering support to African-
American students on campus, and the actual business of running the 
organization. It might choose to have virtual analogs that imitate business 
meetings, discussion groups, and open political forums.<p>
<p>
Note that discussion in a town square can actually be more limited than 
the discussion in a bedroom.  Just as public nudity is prohibited, some 
arguments and actions protected in the bedroom can be prohibited in the 
town square. Thus the ability to create spaces in addition to the 
information agora implies the ability to provide a level of freedom of 
debate and discussion unmatched in any single medium.  <p>
<h2>
The
Media Failure 
</h2>
<p>
We will consider three examples in which the existence of media 
analogies as the dominant paradigm for regulating electronic 
communications created incentives (in the form of potential liability) 
for poor policy decisions in the university environment.  Others have 
argued that the current regulatory regime allows limitations on speech, 
but they have focused on case law rather than the effects of the 
shadows of liability  (Hammond 1995).  We choose
examples in the academic environment not only because it is this 
environment with which we are most familiar, but also because 
universities have the creation and sustenance of dialogue as a primary 
purpose.  Examples from business or government domains would be more 
complicated by questions of misuse of resources. <p>
<p>
In the first case, Carnegie Mellon implemented a broad policy censoring all 
Usenet newsgroups in the alt.sex.* hierarchy (Camp and Riley 1995; 
Steinberg 1995). Though the stated purpose of the policy was to bring 
Carnegie Mellon in compliance with Pennsylvania obscenity law, what 
resulted was the denial of access to all conversations about sex and 
sexuality, and the allowance of some legally obscene material (e.g. child 
pornography) to remain available to the CMU community. <p>
<p>
In the second case, two female students sued Santa Rosa Junior college 
after having been the subject of sexually explicit rants posted to an all-
male class discussion board (Dorgan 1994). The entire situation could have 
been prevented had the professor, students, and university been clear from 
the start about the purpose of the discussion board. Instead, what resulted 
was a temporary job termination, involvement of the Department of 
Education's Office of Civil Rights, and an embarrassing settlement for the 
college. <p>
<p>
Third is the much-hyped Jake Baker case, in which a student at the 
University of Michigan posted an abduction, rape and murder fantasy 
involving a female student in one of his classes. He then sent a second 
email saying, "It's not enough anymore to think about it, I have to do it. 
(MacKinnon 1995)" While most of the hype surrounds the federal case in 
which Baker was arrested for transmitting a threat across state lines, we 
will concern ourselves with the response from the University of Michigan 
itself.   <p>
<h3>
Carnegie Mellon University
</h3>
<p>
In November 1994, Carnegie Mellon announced that it would remove all 
newsgroups in the alt.sex hierarchy, as well as selected groups in the 
alt.binares.pictures.erotica hierarchy, and a few others (Camp and Riley 
1995). The newsgroups were selected for removal by title, not by 
substance. This makes clear that CMU was acting as a distributor not as a 
publisher, since it avoided knowledge of the content of Usenet 
newsgroups. Hence, groups such as alt.sex.fat, which is a support and 
discussion group for issues of sexuality and being overweight, and 
alt.sex.NOT which is a discussion group about abstinence, were banned. 
Similarly, valuable information about sexual health was banned through 
the removal of groups like alt.sex.safe and alt.sex.wizards. <p>
<p>
The policy's stated goal was to comply with state and federal law.  CMU 
determined that it was a distributor of Usenet information and thus had to 
act where the University could not deny knowledge of obscenity.  Thus CMU 
cut a broad swath through the Usenet feeds.  Yet CMU let remain groups 
that regularly contain child pornography, such as 
alt.binaries.pictures.girls. By trying to minimize perceived liability the 
administrators at Carnegie Mellon both limited important sexual discourse 
and failed to remove material which is uniquely prohibited.<p>
<p>
However, had CMU selected for content and removed only the child 
pornography postings, it would be in a position of monitoring.  Monitoring 
is expensive technically -- it involves processor time and coding costs.  It 
is also hazardous in that such monitoring would have created the potential 
for CMU to be a publisher; like Prodigy, the University would have created 
an infrastructure  theoretically capable of monitoring every post.<p>
<p>
As long as the media types framework applies, institutions like CMU 
cannot take the necessary steps to comply with child pornography laws 
without making themselves vulnerable to a publisher's standard of 
libel.<p>
<p>
Consider a more obscure event at CMU. The Women's Center was bombarded 
by hate messages in the spring of 1993. The flame war that ensued was so 
vigorous that readers who subscribed to the board to receive 
announcements of business meetings found it too cumbersome to wade 
through the drivel to the business messages. Furthermore, some women 
felt like their board should be a safe space where discussion could focus 
on women's experiences, not on the wittiest response to aspiring 
Limbaughs. Other women felt it was important to engage the trolls and 
expose them to feminist ideas.  <p>
<p>
They resolved the issue with the traditional feminist "both-and" solution; 
they created a discussion board and an announcement board so people could 
choose whether to enter the town square dialogue with the anti-feminists 
or simply read workspace announcements. The women's center account 
was given the authority to move posts from one board to the other, as 
appropriate. In this way, women maintained a safe space and protected 
free speech at Carnegie Mellon.  <p>
<p>
There was not a single standard applied to both newsgroups.  The 
University had the same level of control in both the assocs.womens-center 
and assocs.womens-center.discussion  groups.  These two newsgroups are 
of the same media type yet one serves as a protected space for  the 
expression of opinions by an underrepresented group and the other serves 
as a completely protected forum for even the most offensive speech.  The 
application of media types to all groups at Carnegie Mellon would prevent 
such distinctions. <p>
<h3>
Santa
Rosa Junior College
</h3>
<p>
When Roger Karraker taught a journalism class at Santa Rosa Junior 
College (SRJC), he maintained an electronic conferencing system.  The 
professor  used the electronic conferencing system to motivate his 
students to have wide ranging discussions unlimited by classroom 
constraints, and to expand the learning experience by familiarizing his 
students  with the electronic medium. At the students' request, he 
established single-sex spaces for the continuation of classroom 
discussions.    <p>
<p>
When the student newspaper published a swimwear ad featuring a woman 
in a thong bikini, one female student picketed the paper to protest the 
objectification of women. After another woman defended her, they both 
became targets of sexually derogatory comments on the all-male bulletin 
board. One of the men told the women about the comments, and they 
complained to Karraker who immediately shut down the single-sex boards. 
However, one student was not satisfied with this response and complained 
to the administration, who put Karraker on paid leave. The other students 
retaliated against the loss of the professor by attacking the woman who 
had made the original complaint.  She dropped out of college, and 
threatened a sex discrimination suit (Dorgan 1995, Lewin 1995).    <p>
<p>
The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) in the department of education demanded 
that the college have an across-the-board policy on all its electronic 
services against sexually explicit comments that could create a hostile 
educational environment.  With respect to Usenet, this would have 
resulted in the termination of the alt.sex hierarchy in addition to the 
removal of much of the soc and talk hierarchies.  In order to meet this 
condition, the University would have had to eliminate many distribution 
lists as well. Arguably, the OCR treated SRJC as a publisher because this 
particular case originated in the journalism class which published the 
school newspaper.  Certainly the journalism class did have newsgroups 
that were published by the class as journalistic endeavors.  Because one 
newsgroup at Santa Rosa was a publication, all newsgroups must be 
publications under the media rubric. <p>
<p>
Consider the  answer of the more subtle question:   what is the correct 
analogy to the physical world? Was it a locker room? A group therapy 
session? Surely in these contexts the speech is to be protected. The group 
therapy analogy is
probably most appropriate considering that students were required to 
abide by a confidentiality rule regarding the contents of the discussions. 
Indeed in such a situation, personal attacks are to be expected and the 
privacy of the participants is paramount.<p>
<p>
If one considers the forum to be an extension of the classroom, as 
Karraker first characterized it,  professional limitations may be placed on 
speech. Vulgar personal attacks are prohibited in a classroom, and 
Karraker as the course instructor would have a  personal and possibly 
legal responsibility to intervene.        <p>
<p>
Regardless of the classification, choosing an analogy for that particular 
electronic space would not have defined all electronic spaces associated 
with the journalism class. The attempt of the OCR to fit the entire college 
computing system into that of a publisher is a misguided solution that 
ignores the nuances of cyberspace, and thus resulted in threats to on-line 
speech.  <p> <p>
The professor's choice to create an specified therapy session in a 
classroom created an environment that resulted in the professor's 
suspension, loss of access to some on-line speech for journalism 
students, threats to many unrelated electronic forums on campus, and one 
young woman's abandonment of academic goals because she perceived it as 
an extension of the classroom.  The lack of a clear conceptual model 
created great harm when there was no intention to do so.  Because all the 
speech was electronically assisted communication did not make all the 
spaces equivalent.  Here again, the lack of consideration of the difference 
in cyberspaces resulted in the loss of access to on-line free speech at 
Santa Rosa Junior College.  <p>
<h3>
University
of Michigan 
</h3>
<p>
Jake Baker posted a set of detailed steps to kidnap, rape, torture, and 
murder another student. Jake Baker named that student and identified her 
living area in alt.sex.stories. What is the University's responsibility under 
different media types?        <p>
<p>
First, if Michigan is a common carrier, their responsibility is essentially 
to do nothing. By definition it does not have any knowledge of the 
information posted to alt.sex.stories and thus has no obligation to 
intervene.   Michigan could have maintained its contention of common 
carriage by refusing to act. <p> <p>
If Michigan is a publisher or a distributor, it must choose to act.   In this 
case the options included deleting the message, or investigating Jake 
Baker's intent, or both. However, acting on that message implies broad 
future control of information and future liability in cases of libel, 
copyright, and other infringements that may not pose the same dangers 
implied by this particular case. <p>
<p>
Consider instead Michigan's responsibility if the issue is one of 
cyberspaces. If alt.sex.stories could be considered a bedroom or dorm 
room, then the University could intervene on the basis that a direct 
physical threat was made and not face future liability.  Quite simply, 
entering one dorm room to prevent a crime does not imply that the 
University has knowledge of all actions in all dorm rooms.        <p>
<p>
An appropriate analogy might be an erotica reading night at a campus cafe. 
People who attend the readings do so knowingly and expect to hear erotic 
stories of an explicit nature.  The University can choose as part of its 
mission to provide students with the opportunity to explore erotic 
literature, and to support its students' writing experiments by providing 
such a forum. However, upon hearing a specific plan of violence directed at 
a specific individual, it is reasonable that the administration would act to 
prevent any clear danger.  In choosing to act in a single case to prevent 
physical harm, the University would not commit to prohibiting erotic 
story hours, or be
considered a distributor of all such papers written on campus.<p>
<p>
In short, the media type classification encourages irresponsibility by 
potentially categorizing an organization based on one action in a 
particular case and then applying the standards of the media type to all 
forums.   <p>
<h2>
Conclusion
and Implications
</h2>
<p>
The classification of the Internet into a media type, or the creation of a 
new media type is tempting for many reasons.  First, the media model for 
electronically assisted communication has served well for decades.. The 
model of four media has remained solid through the early days of the 
wireless revolution, and several court cases have seen fit to apply a 
specific media type to specific provider.    <p>
<p>
Space as the determinant has advantages and disadvantages. The advantage 
is that control over speech may be exercised in some forums, without 
hindering the free flow of information on the Internet as a whole.  Users 
can define and declare the limits of their own spaces.  It would enable a 
broad but nuanced policy where control results in liability, without 
blanket restrictions directed at all providers.  Treating cyberspace as 
cyberspaces also assists in users' right to address and access a public 
forum, as well as users' right to be left alone in their own electronic 
spaces. <p>
<p>
The disadvantage is that there is no graceful unified theory as now exists 
with media types.  There is no overarching theory of speech in spaces, 
rather a quilt of court decisions and regulations.  Like all frameworks, 
regulation of electronic spaces as space could be manipulated.<p>
<p>
As in physical spaces there exist common carriers, publishers, 
distributors and broadcasters in cyberspace.  A single person can use all 
of these services --by sending email through a  simple gateway, by 
creating a Web page, by setting up a reflector, and by spamming. Yet 
cyberspace has more modes and models than can be contained in these four 
media types.  The regulation of cyberspace as a multi-dimensional world 
of spaces is far more complex than the search for the appropriate media 
type. Yet the virtual world requires such complexity.  <p> <p>
