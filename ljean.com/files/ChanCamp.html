this paper, we study the evolution of telecommunications technology
and its impact on law enforcement surveillance.  Privacy and the need
for law enforcement to conduct investigations have not been at the
center of the recent public policy debate.  Yet, policy environments
have approved law enforcement surveillance that can be and is
intrusive.  Law enforcement surveillance therefore deserves
particular attention when discussing the basic human right to
privacy.  We illustrate that despite the gradual acceptance of the
basic human right to privacy, in the digital age the United States
(US) government  continues its historical pattern of using technology
to enhance  its power of search .  The most recent example is the
installation of the Digital Collection System 1000 (DCS1000),
formerly known as Carnivore, a classified packet sniffer, on American
networks by the American federal law enforcement agency.  </FONT></FONT>

that not only is there a technology convergence but also a

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
growth of interception is a result of technological improvements that
have drawn more and more valuable traffic onto telecommunications
channels.  The means by which we communicate (e.g., telegraph,
telephone, electronic mail and video conferencing) have expanded due
to technological changes.  In the twentieth century  the frequency 
of communications and interactions has increased as communications
technology has advanced, with ever  more trivial messages being
transmitted and thus potentially intercepted. [<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Schement
 and Terry 1995]  The ability intercept  those increasingly frequent 
communications (</FONT></SPAN>e.g., wiretaps) means that spying on
communication channels becomes increasingly rewarding for
governments, businesses and criminals.  Laws cannot change the fact
that communications are inherently subject to interception and
digital technology is making interception ever easier.  [Diffie,
1998]</FONT></FONT></P>

</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this paper, we study the evolution of telecommunications technology
and the challenges to surveillance faced by law enforcement agencies.
 We focus on the history of the United States (US).  US government
surveillance will have an increasing impact on the global civil
society because of the globalization  of packet-based communications 
networks- as a great deal of international traffic travels across
American network wires.  The bandwidth exchanges operating on the
coasts of the US illustrate that surveillance policies in the US will
effect citizens in the Pacific Rim and the European communities. 
This was evident by the fact that China lost its Internet connection
to foreign web sites due to a broken fiber optic cable connecting
China to the US.  The Boston Globe reported that the undersea link
carries approximately one-quarter of US-Asian Internet traffic. We
illustrate that the United States government has historically tried
to increase its power of search, despite the gradual acceptance of
the basic human right to privacy.  </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
Sections 2 and 3, we discuss surveillance practices preceding the
widespread adoption of digital communication in the areas of US
postal mail, telegraph and telephone communications.  As <FONT COLOR="#000000">new
technologies arise, law enforcement agencies will continually face
challenges in maintaining their traditional practices  of electronic
surveillance capabilities.  </FONT>In Section 4, we analyze
surveillance in the area of physical surveillance, encrypted
telephony and the Internet (e.g., electronic mail) in the US.  From
the examination of these cases, we will see that not only is there
the much-heralded convergence of telecommunications channels, but
also a resulting convergence of jurisdictions.  Rather than
curtailing law enforcement surveillance activities per se, policy in
the US has emphasized privacy protection of individuals in particular
sectors (e.g., video tapes rentals, credit records).  [Camp, 2000]
The traditional assumption that ensuring the privacy of the
individual will keep government surveillance in check is not adequate
when sectorial protection for privacy is the norm. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
Section 5, we discuss privacy principles on which to build upon in
order to create a coherent technology-neutral policy for law
enforcement surveillance of electronic information.  We discuss how a
US-based digital surveillance standard might comply and conflict with
European data protection principles.  We conclude that the American
legal approach of sectorial protection of privacy  offers less
promise than the  European data-protection paradigm for creating and
maintaining consistent surveillance policies in an time with rapidly
changing information technology. In Section 6, we conclude that
ultimately, to create the foundation for good policy we must be aware
of many factors, including technology, cryptography and electronic
surveillance, the aims and practices of intelligence and law
enforcement agencies, and the history of society's attempts to deal
with similar problems over the previous centuries.  We offer a set of
principles, comparable to but distinct from those offered by the
Council of Europe, for post-convergence surveillance.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Postal
mail privacy depends on the care of the carrier because
communications can be compromised  only through physical interception
of letters and packages.  In colonial America, before a formal postal
system existed, letters and packages were transported in an ad hoc
manner by ship captains, friends or hired delivery men.  Mail
delivered to a central location in town might sit unattended, opened
for inspection by anyone passing by, until the intended recipients
collected their mail.  The privacy-protecting technologies of the
time included  sealing letters with wax or encoding those messages
where secrecy was critical. [Kahn,  1996] These technological fixes
to the problem of communications privacy were found inadequate, and
legal action was taken by the English. Thus  the 1710 English Post
Office Act prohibited the opening of mail except by warrant.  In
1753, the Postmaster General for the English Colonies, Benjamin
Franklin, prompted all postmasters to take an oath not to open mail. 
Yet British officials, not Franklin's postmasters,  regularly opened
mail searching for information regarding plots and conspiracies among
the colonists preceding the American Revolution.  Military
authorities on both sides throughout the American Revolution 
continued the practice of invading privacy by opening letters assumed
to be full of intelligence information.  [Diffie, 1998; Regan, 1995] </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Incentives
to open letters existed even in the early days of the US.  Mail was
easy to intercept and motives came from many sources, such as
partisan rivalries.  George Washington and Thomas Jefferson have both
given accounts suggesting that their letters were opened.  Privacy
protection of mail communications increased to some extent by the
nineteenth century, through a rise in mail volume and the use of
envelopes and locks on mailbags.  On the legal  front, a major postal
statute of 1825 prohibited everyone, not only postal workers, from
opening a letter before it was delivered to the intended recipient. 
[Regan, 1995]  The law made no exemption for opening letters for
official purposes. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Yet
despite the fundamental respect that the mails held, the various
crises of the nation resulted in significant changes in privacy of
the mails.  In <I>Searight v. Stokes, 44 US (3 How.) 151, 169 (1845)</I>,
a case on state taxation of Federal mail, it was determined that mail
is not only under the protection of the Government, but that the mail
is the property of the Government. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Social
tensions  have repeatedly given rise to the call to limit the
distribution of controversial ideas using the mails. During his State
of the Union speech, President Andrew Jackson proposed making
abolitionist mailings illegal in the Southern states.  This was
objected to as an extension of Federal power and failed to pass. 
However, after a bloody extended civil conflict, the mood of the
nation was considerably altered.  In 1878, the Supreme Court elevated
this protection against examination of letters by clarifying Fourth
Amendment coverage to first class postal letters in <I>Ex parte
Jackson (96 US 727)</I>.  [Diffie, 1998]  However, in this ruling the
Court allowed a privilege for Federal Government in the mail of lower
classes by stating, &quot;the right to designate what shall be
carried necessarily involves the right to determine what shall be
excluded.&quot;  The extension of governmental power to examine mail
does not seem extreme, when placed against the recognition that a
considerable amount of the nation was under or recently had been
under martial law. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
next threat to second- and third-class mail was the concern of
morality resulting from new technologies and the associated economic
dislocations.  Anthony Comstock was a leader of the
turn-of-the-century crusades to protect the corruptible morality of
America's youth from the overwhelming intensity of new media
(including broadcasting, color lithography and automated presses). 
As Postmaster General, Comstock prohibited the use of mail to send
any &quot;obscene, lewd, or lascivious book, pamphlet, picture,
paper, print, or other publication of an indecent character.&quot; 
Implementing such controls required regular searches of second- and
third-class mail and seizures of documents intended for distribution.
 Such controls still hold today in some states, for example,
prohibiting unsolicited mailing regarding contraceptives and women's
health.  [Beisel, 1997]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Similar
importance was given to mail as the Cold War emerged in the early
1950s.  In the twentieth century, the US Postal Office was allowed to
detain &quot;communist political propaganda.&quot;  [Alderman &amp;
Kennedy, 1995]  Until 1965, in <I>Lamont v. Postmaster General (381
US 301), </I>the government ownership of the mails could outstrip the
right of the people to private mail.  That the  right to speak and
the closely related freedom to read actually require the freedom to
read without fear of surveillance was not fully recognized with
respect to the mails until Griswold V. Connecticutt overthrew the
remnants of Comstockery.   [Cohen, 1996]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Controls
on mail remained until the seventh decade of the twentieth century. 
Throughout this period, private mail carriers could be hired for the
purpose of message delivery.  Private mail carriers had at all times
(excluding war) the unquestioned support of the Fourth Amendment. 
Similar rights exist today; however, the private carriers can now
choose to cede these rights for the packages in their possession, and
thus the users.  Again &quot;the right to designate what shall be
carried&quot; includes designating the rights allowed to the
recipient and senders of parcels.  For example, United Parcel
Services (UPS) allows bulk searches of its packages (e.g., law
enforcement agents who bring in drug-sniffing dogs) while Federal
Express (FedEx) requires a warrant for specific packages. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the age of Benjamin Franklin, the Postmaster General held a high
standard.  Later, as violent political disagreement tore the nation,
the primacy of government ownership came to rule.  This peaked with
the appointment of Anthony Comstock, who leaves his name as a synonym
for censorship.  With respect to the mails, the sorting and
distribution technologies have changed but the security of an
individual envelope has varied little during the centuries.  Public
mood overwhelmed Constitutional controls, reaching a peak at the end
of the nineteenth century.  There are traditions in the law to argue
for broad-based prohibition of materials, as well as arguments for a
high degree of user privacy.  Like the concept of individual equality
and autonomy before the law, the development of privacy in the mails
was stated gracefully during the nation's founding.   Yet the
attaining the ideals required  two centuries of halting  progress.   </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
advent of the telegraph and telephone brought forth new methods of
communications.  Because the communications are conducted in a
physically private space and sent by wire, people assume their
communications have a level of privacy that often does not exist. 
[Regan, 1995]  Telegraph information can be obtained by reading the
messages from copies kept by the telegraph companies or by tapping
the wire.  The US government preferred the first search method
because wide government surveillance of the telegraph required
technical skill and training.  [Diffie, 1998]  Telegraph
communications were constantly tapped during the American Civil War
by both the Union and Confederate armies to determine battle plans
and troop movements.  Like the Internet, the telegraph systems were
based on early military investment.  Also like the Internet, the
private use of the technology easily outstripped the
government-related uses as the technology became widely adopted.   </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
the government tried to control the wired communications medium by
obtaining copies of telegrams and censoring messages, many of the
company operators refused to cooperate with the government.  It
seemed that the government sough to establish broad search privileges
for itself while trying to protect communications privacy from the
owners and operators of the networks.  Nevertheless, public officials
and private parties discovered how to tap communications almost
immediately after the invention of the telegraph and telephone. 
[Diffie, 1998]  Wiretapping would occur for many decades due to the
ease of tapping and the value of information obtained.  Press
organizations would tap the wire communications of rival
organizations to facilitate being first to report major news events. 
Wiretapping was also used for personal financial gain in the
mid-1800s when several Western Union operators and a Wall Street
broker intercepted messages regarding financial matters and
substituted false information.  [Regan, 1995]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
is the case today, privacy-enhancing technologies and regulations
were sought to address the lack of privacy.  Five years after the
patent of the telephone, a patent for a telephone scrambler was
issued.  During the war emergency of World War I, Congress
effectively took ownership of the telephone company, paying 'rents'
instead of dividends to holders of stock in AT&amp;T.  After the war
there was considerable debate with respect to the wisdom of private
ownership, which was increasingly a global anomaly.  While under
governmental control, Congress prohibited the tapping of or
interference with telegraphs and telephone messages &quot;without
authority.&quot;  After the war emergency, over the objections of the
Department of War, the telephone system was placed again in private
hands and the controls on wiretapping passed out of effect.  The sole
purpose of the legislation was to protect the property of the
telegraph and telephone companies and the government while under
government control; not for protecting the privacy of users or
content of communications.  [Regan, 1995]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It
was not until the late 1920s when privacy of communications would
become a public issue.  Across the nation different local police
departments followed vastly different standards, some using
wiretapping regularly and some seeing it as a clear violation.  By
1927, more than twenty-five states made wiretapping a crime but
wiretapping was prevalent at both the state and federal levels.  The
constitutionality of wiretapping was first tested in the <I>Olmstead
v. United States, 277 US 438 (1928)</I>.  Based on telephone wiretaps
presented by federal agents, Roy Olmstead, a bootlegger in the state
of Washington, was convicted of violating federal Prohibition laws. 
The federal trial judge admitted the wiretap evidence even though
Washington state law prohibited wiretapping.  Olmstead appealed his
conviction arguing that the wiretap evidence should not have been
admitted, however the appeals court upheld the conviction.  The
appeals court ruled that because there was no trespassing or seizing
of physical property, wiretapping did not violate either the Fourth
or Fifth Amendment.  The Supreme Court reviewed the appeals court
decision and supported it.  [Regan, 1995]  In the majority opinion,
the Supreme Court found it to be the job of Congress to protect
telephone privacy by stating, &quot;the policy of protecting the
secrecy of telephone messages by making them, when intercepted,
inadmissible as evidence in federal criminal trials may be adopted by
Congress through legislation, but it is not for the courts to adopt
it by attributing an enlarged and unusual meaning to the Fourth
Amendment.&quot;  Yet the ringing dissent argued presciently &quot;subtler
and more far-reaching means of invading privacy have become available
to the Government.  Discovery and invention have made it possible for
the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the
rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the
closet.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
notion of wiretaps as searches that were not protected under the
Constitution led the way for widespread wiretapping.  There was no
uniform wiretap policy among the federal agencies or between the
states.  Wiretapping was used as means of political and social
control, beyond the limits of proper law enforcement and occurred
unchecked due to public ignorance.  [Diffie, 1998]  Some agency heads
believed that law enforcement interests justified privacy invasions
imposed by wiretapping while others did not.  Although bills were
introduced in Congress to ban and regulate wiretapping, wiretapping
practices continued without any change until the development of the
current wiretapping policy in 1967 through the courts when the
<I>Olmstead</I> case was overturned in <I>Katz v. United States,</I>
<I>389 US 347 (1967).</I></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
<I>Katz,</I> the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) placed a
bugging device in a telephone booth with the intention of monitoring
Katz's conversations, allegedly regarding gambling operations.  The
Supreme Court overturned <I>Olmstead</I> and ruled that the telephone
bug violated privacy and constituted a search and seizure under the
Fourth Amendment.  [Regan, 1995]  The Fourth Amendment of the
Constitution was now interpreted as providing protection against
illegal searches of an individual and not just an individual's
property.    </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Title
III of the Telecommunications Act  specified crimes for which a court
order could be requested and established procedural requirements for
law enforcement, including obtaining a court order approved by a
high-ranking prosecutor; proving that probable cause existed for
believing that a crime had been committed, that the target of the
surveillance was involved, and that evidence would be obtained
through the surveillance; certifying that other investigative
procedures would be ineffective; and describing how the surveillance
effort would be minimized.  If an application met these requirements,
a judge could approve the court order for thirty days with a possible
extension.  At the close of the surveillance, notice was to be given
to the people affected, unless the judge decided to postpone the
notice.  Illegally obtained evidence could not be used in any
official proceedings.  [Regan, 1995]  Yet these requirements were
widely ignored in the practice of wiretapping by the FBI, with
documented cases of misuse of wiretaps for forty more years. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Technological
advances during the 1980s, e.g., communications transmitted over
radio, microwave, satellite and fiber optics, threatened the privacy
protections offered under Title III.  Title III covered the &quot;aural
acquisition&quot; of &quot;wire and oral&quot; communications that
were carried over common carrier communications facilities.   The
practice of wiretapping seemed threatened, as callers could use
Caller ID, Call Forwarding and other database services to escape
surveillance.  In response, Congress enacted the Communications
Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA), extending Title III protections and
requirements to all new types of voice, data and video
communications, including cellular phones, electronic mail, computer
transmissions and voice pagers.  [Regan, 1995] </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the case of emerging technologies law enforcement has sought to
ensure the continued compliance of communications companies, sough 
to require the adoption of some technologies (e.g., key escrow), and
taken  advantage and creating their own surveillance technologies
(e.g., Carnivore). In summary, the normal protections for privacy for
postal communications do not hold in for electronic communications. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Today,
a variety of technologies invade the privacy of millions of
individuals everyday.  For example, frequent shopper programs gather
the buying habits of millions of consumers into a computerized
database, which may then be sold to marketing firms.  Physical
surveillance, e.g., electronic video and metal detectors, for
security purposes is employed in many federal and state government
buildings, banks, department stores and airports.  Cordless phone
conversations can be accidentally intercepted in a home or on a car
radio.  While these examples are contemporary and generally accepted
by the American public, the concerns about privacy and technology are
not new.  [Regan, 1995; Alderman and Kennedy, 1995]  Most physical
surveillance techniques are accepted as public safety measures.

unaware that their faces were digitally captured for computer
comparison to criminal records or that they could be questioned or
held by law enforcement officers.  The ACLU has requested public
hearings regarding the surveillance and complete information of how
the images were and hopefully disposed of.  It is not certain what
databases were used for comparison nor if the surveillance activity
was authorized by sports officials.  Because there was no
notification of the surveillance, the ACLU is concerned that Fourth
Amendment rights of those in attendance were violated.  </FONT></FONT>

high-tech surveillance devices make it possible to monitor activities
inside a person's home without any physical intrusion.   In the
recent Supreme Court case <I>Kyllo v. United States,</I> No. 99-8508,
the lawyer for an Oregon man convicted of growing marijuana in his
home argued that the police engaged in an illegal search by using a
thermal imager to detect the distinctive heat pattern made by the
high-intensity lights that are often used for growing marijuana.  The
police used the information as the basis for obtaining a search
warrant for the house.  The issue is whether law enforcement agents
violated the Fourth Amendment by failing to obtain a warrant before
using the thermal imager.  The attorney for the government argued
that people did not have a reasonable expectation to privacy &quot;in
the heat that's on the exterior surfaces of their walls.&quot;  Under
court precedents, people forfeit any expectation of privacy if they
conduct business in front of an open window.  It would be an
astonishing jump to conclude that people who fail to stop the
emission of &quot;waste&quot; heat give up their right to privacy in
their homes.  [Greenspan, 2001]</FONT></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Institutions
and locations have long been singled out in American law for
particular protection from or submission to surveillance: private
homes, libraries, medical establishments, public assemblies and
universities.  The work factor and expense of physical surveillance
has long been the greatest constraint upon it.  Constant physical
surveillance will tax the resources of even the most determined
regime, as the files of the East German police illustrate.  These
constraints are being lessened in particular by a combination of
video and face recognition technologies.  Video surveillance brings
the previously exempt case of physical surveillance into the realm of
the wiretap with the creation of ubiquitous automated surveillance. 
Thus, the use of such devices should also be included in any
consideration of electronic surveillance. </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
US government is still attempting to establish broad search
privileges expand despite the gradual acceptance of a basic human
right to privacy.  The advancement of computer technology,
specifically encryption, is proving to be a challenge to law
enforcement surveillance.  The response of the FBI and other law
enforcement agencies since the late 1980s has been a series of
programs designed to maintain its wiretapping abilities.  The
programs are designed to address the difficulties in maintaining
electronic surveillance and to enhance their ability to monitor
communications.  First, in 1992 the FBI introduced the Digital
Telephony Proposal, which required telephone switching equipment to
include provisions that provided for authorized wiretapping.  Because
the FBI found it difficult to install court-authorized wiretaps due
to the new switching technology, the bill mandated all
telecommunications providers, both public carriers and private branch
exchanges, to design systems that would assist government
interceptions and to bear all the costs for redesign.  [Diffie, 1998]
 Next, the US government tried to adopt a new federal standard for
communications called Clipper.  Clipper is a key-escrow system that
provide user with strong cryptographic equipment to protect their
privacy against most individuals but guarantees that the government
has the ability to read the communications if it wished.  The
National Security Agency (NSA), an intelligence agency for
intercepting foreign government communications and breaking their
encryption codes, developed the cryptographic algorithm, known as
Skipjack.  [Schneier, 1997]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Both
the Digital Telephony Proposal and Clipper failed to gain acceptance
from industry and Congress.  The underlying idea behind these two
plans was to provide a &quot;back door&quot; for the US government to
decrypt messages for the purposes of law enforcement and national
security.  The two proposals allowed the government to maintain its
ability to wiretap to ensure a secure society.  Privacy advocates, on
the other hand, feared the abuse of information collection by the
government.  In addition, there was no independent review of the
Skipjack algorithm because the NSA classified it.  Businesses
objected because of the difficulty of integrating the necessary
hardware.  Clipper also lacked marketability because it would not
interest foreign customers, as the back door was only available to
the US government.  [Diffie, 1998; Schneier, 1997]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>By
1994, the FBI modified the Digital Telephony Proposal to limit
wiretapping to common carriers and apportion $500 million to cover
costs.  Carries would have 3 years to meet the terms and after that,
a failure to perform a wiretap order could result in a heavy fine. 
Congress tried to accommodate the FBI's desire to maintain
surveillance capabilities by passing the bill under the name
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA).  The
telecommunications industry is not responsible for decrypting or for
ensuring the government's ability to decrypt.  However, they are
required to assist law enforcement agencies with interception needs. 
Law enforcement agencies are still required to obtain court approval
for wiretaps.  [Diffie, 1998]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
current debate involving law enforcement electronic surveillance
involves the Digital Collection System 1000 (DCS1000), formerly known
as Carnivore.  DCS1000 is a software system developed and introduced
by the FBI in 1997 for Internet surveillance.  [Kerr, 2000]  The
FBI's traditional investigative process of wiretapping is ill-suited
for investigating electronic crimes because of the way the Internet
connects thousands of systems with millions of users and crosses
national boundaries.  The Internet makes it very difficult to be
policed by traditional means and be subjected to exact targeting. 
Unlike telephony systems, which generally provide only voice and low
bandwidth communications services, the Internet provides a host of
other forms of communications.  Internet users frequently use
electronic mail and electronic messaging services to communicate with
one another using text instead of voice.  These messages are often
the targets of court-ordered interception.  Some services on the
World Wide Web resemble print more than they resemble a phone call. 
Other services, such as streaming video, resemble broadcast media,
such as television.  These types of communications are less-commonly
the targets of court-ordered interception, but are now easily under
surveillance.  </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A
balance must be struck between employing new technologies to lawfully
obtain information while providing enhanced privacy protection.  This
not only applies to the law enforcement community but to the private
sector and the American people.  The Internet is allowing everyone to
gain the ability to keep close track of individual's interests.  Web
pages can record IP addresses and other available information. 
[Diffie, 1998]  Users can send electronic mail on the Web that
informs them when the recipient has picked up the message. 
Historically, the US has taken an ad hoc approach in considering
surveillance.  In the following section, we establish
post-convergence surveillance principles, determined by examining
pre-convergence surveillance and propose a coherent
technology-neutral policy for law enforcement surveillance of
electronic information.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
illustrated in the previous sections, communications are inherently
subject to interception and digital technology has made ubiquitous
interception ever more simple.  Laws cannot change these facts but
may regulate the surveillance and collection of information. 
[Diffie, 1998]  Historically, US emphasis has been on protecting the
privacy rights of individuals rather than restraining the
surveillance activities of organizations.  Yet, protecting individual
rights does not adequately check the surveillance activities of the
government and organizations.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We
recognize that the needs of law enforcement agencies to intercept and
collect information about the communications of criminals and about
criminal activities must be balanced against expectations of
communication privacy for those who are not under investigation.  Any
surveillance system for the Internet and other packet communications
should meet the requirement for openness.  This will ensure that each
individual's right to privacy is protected but still allow law
enforcement agencies access to information that they need.  The
DCS1000 system has failed the openness principle.  Because it is a
classified system, DCS1000 cannot be proven secure regardless of the
assertions of those allowed access to the details.  One possible
reason for the classification of DCS100 is the fear that the system
would be compromised.  Public exposure, however, does not necessarily
weaken a secure system.  For a system to be proven secure, it must be
subject to public scrutiny and peer review.  Potential areas for
exploitation can be reduced if the programming community can be given
the opportunity to conduct tests and to search for software bugs.   </FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ultimately,
to make good policy we must consider the sort of world in which we
want to live and what effects our actions will, indeed can, have in
bringing about such a world.  Such considerations depends on
awareness of many factors, including the technology or cryptography
and electronic surveillance, the aims and practices of intelligence
and law enforcement, and the history of society's attempts to deal
with similar problems over more than a century. [Diffie, 1998] 
Concurrent with our work, the Council of Europe has been developing a

Some of our ideas comply with the European principles, while others
do not.  In the development of a coherent technology-neutral policy

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ensuring
the privacy of the individual in the market is not adequate for
ensuring the privacy of the individual with respect to law
enforcement; however, such marketplace privacy is a pre-requisite for
citizen privacy.  The European principles for data protection and
surveillance offer the beginning of a foundation on which to build
technology-neutral standards for surveillance; although given the
uniquely and necessarily intrusive nature of law enforcement
surveillance, the principles are not entirely suitable.  </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It
is understood that surveillance is a high priority in the law
enforcement community.  Policymakers need to take a broader view in
examining this issue and creating legislation that serves the
interests of the nation.  Policy initiatives involving
telecommunications surveillance need to have a solid understanding of
the technologies involved.  The targeting of specific individuals
should not infringe upon the privacy rights of other users on the
telecommunications network.  Privacy must be afforded especially to
those who are not themselves the subject of investigation, but whose
communications might happen to have been intercepted incidentally. 
If technologies are to be developed for the purpose of surveillance,
then open source development should be aggressively encouraged.  </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Policies
need to be technology-neutral in order to withstand the further
evolution of telecommunications technologies and services.  In
particular, we argue that the telecommunications industry assist law
enforcement agencies in their interception needs instead of the
government implementing their own surveillance techniques.  For
example, the ISPs would provide filtered - not raw - information to
law enforcement, as telephone companies do in response to court
orders for telephone taps.  Such a practice will create a window of
transparency whereby law enforcement requests for communications are
documented and the transfer of data can be observed.  The
increasingly private nature of networks offers promise that an
increasing transparency of dataflow to law enforcement is possible. 
However, the European Council proposal would lead to ineffective
one-time analysis of dynamic surveillance technologies and a loss of
privacy rights as the lowest common denominator is adopted across
jurisdictions.  As seen in the United States, while powerful
individual leadership may create high privacy levels during times of
transition, clear and comprehensive policies are needed to prevent
later crises and concerns from overriding initial privacy protection.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
