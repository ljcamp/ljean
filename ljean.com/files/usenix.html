Abstract<i><a href="usenix_fn.html#fn0">[*]</a> </i></h2>
<p>
<i>What properties of money are important for electronic commerce?  We argue
that both transactional and privacy properties distinguish electronic commerce
systems.  We provide a quick overview of the history of money.  We then
consider privacy provided by different forms of money, and socially desirable
disclosure of information as specified by legal reporting requirements. We
classify electronic and traditional commerce systems into two categories:<p>
* token systems, which exchange markers representing value<p>
* notational systems, where value is stored as notations in a ledger or
computer.  <p>
We analyze different forms of traditional money based on the degree to which
they protect the privacy and preserve transactional ACID (atomicity,
consistency, isolation, durability) properties.  Finally we apply our
evaluation criteria to two proposed electronic commerce systems: <a href = http://www.digicash.com/>Digicash</a>, (Chaum, 1985; Chaum, 1992) a token-based system; and <a href=http://www.ini.cmu.edu/NETBILL/home.html>NetBill,</a> (Sirbu, 1995) a notational system.</i><hr>
<h2>
1 Token and Notational Money</h2><p>
As befits its central role in our market economy, money has been the subject of
much consideration.  As researchers build new electronic forms of money, it is
important to keep fundamental monetary properties in mind.  This paper examines
these properties for both traditional and electronic commerce.<p>
Money can be defined either in terms of the functions it performs, or in terms
of its representative forms.  Scholars generally agree that money serves three
major functions.  Perhaps most important is its role as a <i>medium of
exchange</i>.  By replacing barter with a two step process of selling one good
for money, which is then used to purchase another good, exchange transactions
are greatly simplified.  As a <i>standard of value</i>, money units are used to
measure the worth of different goods or services so that their value can be
compared in terms of a single numeraire.  Finally, money serves as a <i>store
of value.  </i>Wealth may be stored more easily in the form of money than as
cattle or loaves of bread.<p>
Consistent with its function as a store of value, many of the earliest forms of
money consisted of valuable objects which people were willing to take in trade.
Thus the gold in a gold coin may have a value as a commodity comparable to its
monetary worth.  Other valuable items which have been used as money include
jewels, shells, arrowheads and other tools (Haddon, 1949).<p>
Eventually, money in the form of an asset with intrinsic value yielded to the
need for money convenient to transport, exchange, and store.  Thus, the use of
tokens having no intrinsic value became common.  The first paper money in the
United States was legally negotiable notes issued by banks which required
payment on demand of an equivalent value of gold (Rubin, 1994).  These notes
had no intrinsic value, but were readily convertible to intrinsically valuable
money.  <p>
Easily convertible notes imposed some of the same limits on economic growth as
intrinsically valuable coins.  Thus easily convertible notes yielded to the use
of trusted paper.  While today's dollar may still serve as a store of value,
currency itself no longer consists of tokens with intrinsic value.  Since 1971,
United States currency has not been convertible to gold (Rubin, 1994).  The use
of mere pieces of paper as a medium of exchange, rather than tokens with
intrinsic value, rests on a foundation of trust among the public that these
pieces of paper will continue to be accepted in exchange and will serve as a
stable store of value. A loss of trust could lead to a rapid return to barter,
as is seen in countries where hyperinflation has rendered paper currency
worthless overnight.<p>
While notes are considerably more convenient than gold coins, they are still
difficult to exchange in large amounts, and transport or store securely.
Currently, most money consists not of pieces of paper currency, but rather of
notations in the ledgers of depository institutions such as banks.  We refer to
this as <i>notational </i>money to distinguish it from <i>token</i> money or
currency.  Exchanges based on notational money require the debiting of one
party's account and the crediting of another party's account.  Institutions
accepting demand deposits are required by law to be prepared to convert these
notational deposits into currency on demand, thus providing convertibility
between demand deposits and currency.  Today, the amount of money which exists
solely in the records of depository institutions vastly exceeds the value of
currency in circulation (Heggestad, 1993).<p>
A variety of instruments are used to instruct a bank to transfer notational
money between accounts; the most common is a check.  A complex system involving
the Federal Reserve as a clearinghouse supports check clearing when accounts
are held at different banks.  In the last several decades, instructions to
transfer notational money between accounts are increasingly sent
electronically: wire transfers, ATM transactions, or more generally, Electronic
Funds Transfer.  <p>
Notational and token currency are boundary conditions. For example, cashiers
checks are notational money, but they share some of the properties of token
money.  There are also interfaces between the two: ATM machines and bank
tellers exchange notational currency for token currency.  <hr>
<h2>
2 Desirable Characteristics of Money
</h2><p>
To realize its multiple functions, money must have several characteristics both
in individual transactions and as a currency system enabling these
transactions.  In this section, we enumerate these key characteristics.<a
href="usenix_fn.html#fn1">[1]</a>   We use the computer science vocabulary to
describe transactions.<p>
Consider purchasing an item.  This transaction should have four
characteristics: atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability.  These four
properties are commonly used to describe computerized transaction systems and
are referred to as the ACID properties (Gray, 1993).<p>
* Atomicity:  Either a transaction occurs completely or it does not occur at
all.  For example, consider what happens when I transfer funds from a savings
account to a checking account.  Either my checking account is credited and my
savings account is debited or neither account balance changes. (Tygar, 1996)<p>
* Consistency: All relevant parties must agree on critical facts of the
exchange.  For example, if I buy a good for three dollars, the merchant and I
should both agree on the amount of the purchase.  After the purchase is
completed, we must agree on that fact as well.<p>
* Isolation: Transactions should not interfere with each other, and the result
of a set of overlapping transactions must be equivalent to some sequence of
those transactions executed in non-concurrent serial order.  <p>
* Durability: Even if my computer or the merchant's computer crashes, we should
be able to recover to the last consistent state.  For example, money that was
available to a computer before it crashed should not disappear when the machine
reboots.  <p>
We can further subdivide atomicity into two cases: money-transfer atomicity and
goods-transfer atomicity.  In money-transfer atomicity, funds are transferred
atomically.  In goods-transfer atomicity, not only is money transferred
atomically, but the goods are also linked atomically with the transfer of
money.  For example, if I pay a dollar for a text file but never receive that
text file, then goods-transfer atomicity is violated.  <p>
Besides the ACID transaction properties, money has other desirable
characteristics.  The effort (and cost) associated with conducting a
transaction with all the desirable properties should be low so as to make low
value transactions economical.  Also, as a medium of exchange, money must make
possible both low value and very high value transactions.  This is facilitated
by <i>divisibility:</i> mechanisms which allow for the exchange of multiple low
denomination instruments for a single high denomination instrument.  <p>
Monetary systems should also be <i>scaleable</i> in the number of users.  Money
systems must support many consumers simultaneously buying goods from many
merchants.<p>
The larger the community of users who trust and accept the particular form of
money, the more that form of money's value as a medium of exchange is
increased.  Thus, a single national currency is preferable to a plethora of
local currencies issued by regional banks.  Similar considerations are driving
the European Community to consider a single currency.  Alternatively, there
must be well accepted and relatively fixed mechanisms for converting among
various forms of money.  We refer to this property as
<i>interoperability</i>.<p>
Money should have temporal consistency as well as transactional consistency.
For money to hold its store of value, it must not be possible for individuals
to create or counterfeit money.  An excess of money will lead to a loss of
trust in money as a store of value and consequently as a medium of exchange.
In this paper, we concern ourselves only with unauthorized creation of  money
(rather than restricting governments, banks, and other authorized
institutions.)  It should be easy to distinguish "authorized" money from
illegitimate money  (McClellan, 1995).  Public trust that money is legitimate
is an essential element in its successful use as a medium of exchange.
(Heggestad, 1992; Rubin, 1994; Haddon, 1949)<p>
Money must also have temporal durability as well as transactional durability.
When we put money away for "a rainy day," we don't want it to fade away. Money
should be easy to store and retrieve. Here we refer to temporal consistency and
durability by saying that currency is conserved.<p>
Having considered transactional properties of fund transfers, we now consider
how information in different types of transactions is disclosed to various
participants and observers.  In any transaction, there are many pieces of
information and at least two distinct parties.  Among the pieces of information
are the amount, date, time and location of the transaction; the identities of
the parties; the nature of the goods being purchased; and even the demeanor of
the parties.  When any piece of information held by one party is hidden from
some other party, that information is said to be <i>private</i>.  When a
party's identity is hidden, then the transaction is said to be
<i>anonymous</i>.  Transaction participants may want to control the level of
privacy or anonymity.  Different pieces of transaction information may be
accorded different levels of privacy or anonymity: a piece of information may
be easily observed, may have a limited range of values, may be observed only
under certain conditions,<a href="usenix_fn.html#fn2">[2]</a> or be completely
hidden.<p>
When traditional (non-electronic) token currency is exchanged, there is
typically limited anonymity.  Merchants or observers can narrow the range of
possible customers in a cash purchase: the customer's gender, race, age, and
(potentially) social class; the time of the transaction; and the location of
the transaction can be determined by simple observation.  Disclosures to third
parties are limited in practice by the relative difficulty of physical (as
opposed to data) surveillance.<p>
There are also a substantial set of legal reporting requirements.  In the
United States, for statutory reasons, any electronic commerce system should be
able to: <p>
* provide detailed transaction information under subpoena (12 USC
Sec.1829, Bank Secrecy Act); <p>
* prevent disclosure to law enforcement except under subpoena (12 USC
Sec.3403, Financial Privacy Act); <p>
* promptly report any transaction above $10,000 (12 USC Sec.1829, Money
Laundering Act); <p>
* store a copy of any transaction above $100 (12 USC Sec.1829, Money
Laundering Act); and<p>
* record any action on a joint account in the records of all parties (15 USC
Sec.1591, Equal Credit Opportunity Act).  <p>
A notational currency system that can create and disseminate credit information
as a primary business purpose must also:<p>
* provide copies of consumer records to that consumer at his or her request (15
USC Sec.1681, Fair Credit Reporting Act);<p>
* delete obsolete information (15 USC Sec.1681, 42 USC Sec.3608,
12 USC Sec.1708);<p>
* provide relief to consumers in case of an error (15 USC Sec.1681, 42
USC Sec.3608, 12 USC Sec.1708);<p>
* limit data dissemination based on the primary business purpose of the
requester (15 USC Sec.1681).<p>
Any notational system which is used to transfer wages must also provide a
record, without the possibility of deletion, of personal income, or assure that
the employer is able to do so (United States Tax Code, Section 61).  Any
currency system which is accessed by a card or similar device must protect the
consumer against fraud by assuming all losses over $50 resulting from the loss
of this device (when informed of such a loss by the consumer) (15 USC 1693, 12
USC Sec.3403 ).<p>
 These requirements are extended if an electronic notational currency system
provides more than notational currency transactions.  For example, a system
which removes the need for consumer credit agencies needs to provide some equal
or better form of fraud prevention than credit agencies' protective bulletins.
<p>
These reporting requirements are typical rather than exhaustive.  For further
discussion of the types of reporting requirements, please see the appendix.<p>

3.1
Cash: Physical Token Money
</h2><p>
Cash is token currency.  Cash offers both privacy and anonymity because a
dollar does not contain information that can be used to determine its
transaction history.  Neither does the exchange of cash necessarily create a
record including the identities of those involved.  Cash transactions usually
provide anonymity of the buyer but not the seller.  The privacy of cash is
limited by the potential for physical observation.  The information available
to different parties in a cash transaction is shown in Table 1.
<p>

</pre><p>
Table 1:  Information Available to the Parties In a Cash Transaction<p>
Here we consider an observer who is physically well-placed:  behind or beside
the purchaser with a clear view of both parties and the transaction. A bank
employee or officer of the law can obtain all the information available to an
observer.  However, there are no bank or law enforcement records produced in a
cash transaction.  It is reasonable to assume that no bank employee or law
enforcement officer observes most cash transactions.  Therefore the information
available to a bank or to law enforcement is limited by what they would obtain
from written records.  Reporting of some transactions is required by law, but
these reports depend on the active cooperation of the parties involved.<p>
Paper currency trivially fulfills most of the requirements for an ACID
transaction, including money-transfer atomicity.  However, partially because
cash is physical, cash suffers from scale limitations in transaction size and
distance.  Large transfers, such as those between banks, are problematic.
Also, goods-transfer atomicity fails, especially when the transaction is over a
distance.<p>
There are no limits to scale in the number of users of cash, except those
imposed by limits on the number of bills.  Not only are individual transactions
isolated, but the system is also free from bottlenecks.  <p>
Clearly there are security failures in the form of counterfeit notes, but
security is generally maintained by a time-tested work factor.  The design of
the bills is periodically updated to discourage counterfeiting.  Systems-level
failures in the paper currency system are prevented by risk-limiting
regulation, federal depository insurance, and the sheer magnitude of the task
of passing enough counterfeit currency to upset the entire system.  <p>
Cash requires some trust between users.  If a bill is determined to be
counterfeit, the holder of the bill is not compensated.  The validity of a bill
can be partially verified during the transaction by visual inspection.  By
accepting cash, merchants imply only that they trust their own ability to
detect counterfeits.  <p>
Cash is divisible in that there are many denominations; a large amount can be
broken into many smaller amounts, and many smaller amounts can be exchanged for
a single large denomination.<p>
Cash is interoperable because it is legal tender.  In fact, the lack of
interoperability of state currencies was a driving force behind the creation of
a national currency.
<p>
<h2>
3.2
Checks: Physical Transfers of Notational Money
</h2><p>
Checks simultaneously create a transaction and a record.  This record includes
customer identity, date, location, and amount of a purchase; and is available
to all the parties in the transaction, including all banks and clearinghouses
involved.  In the United States, there is no legal constraint on the disclosure
by banks of customer purchasing habits, except that information can not be
improperly disclosed to the government<a href="usenix_fn.html#fn3">[3]</a>.
Absent explicit customer notation, checks provide <i>content privacy</i>.
Content privacy means only that the actual purchases made are never necessarily
recorded by any third party; the existence, location and parties to a
transaction might be known.  <p>
Banks' records of transactions must be available for law enforcement access for
five years after the initial transaction.  Banks, and therefore government, may
obtain partial information on a purchase if it is so noted on the check.  Banks
offer credit information to direct marketers and potential employers. They also
provide records to law enforcement under subpoena.  However, the retrieval,
aggregation, and distribution of data derived from checks is limited by the
expense of image and handwriting recognition systems.  <p>
A check is not a token that represents value; it is a contract that authorizes
the exchange of money from one account to another.  Checks are instructions to
transfer notational currency between demand deposit accounts.<p>
Table 2 shows the information available to all parties in a checking
transaction.  Again,, we consider a well-placed observer who can actually read
the check.  The assumptions about law enforcement from the cash discussion
remain true.  (We put table entries that differ from the cash, as shown in
Table 1, in boldface.)

<pre>

Table
2:  Information Available to the Parties In a Check Transaction<p>
Checks are money-transfer atomic; however, the status of a transaction is not
clear for several days.  Until a check has cleared or a stop payment order is
in place, the check is in play and any transaction involving the check must be
held open.  <p>
Checks are not goods-transfer atomic because of the length of time required to
clear a check and for the same reason that cash is not goods-transfer atomic.<p>
Checks are consistent in that both the merchant and customer agree on the
amount of the check.<p>
Checks are not isolated.  The validity of a check, and the outcome of the
checking transaction, may depend on another transaction.  For example, my
paycheck must be deposited for my rent check to be valid.  Notice that if I
have two cash notes, the fact that one is counterfeit does not affect the value
of the other.  <p>
Checks are durable after final settlement.  It is, in fact, straightforward to
create notational currency that is more durable than paper currency.  Duplicate
notations can be stored at physically separate locations so that if a single
physical location is destroyed, no money need be lost.  Paper currency cannot
be copied or reproduced for access at a separate location or a later time in
the way that notational currency can.  (However, paper currency also cannot be
deleted by a program error! ) <p>
Checking transactions are not limited by size.  The efficacy of a check in
notational transfers, especially for large transactions, is limited by the need
for trust.  Checks depend on the credit of the issuer, and the validity of a
check cannot be determined by examination.  The holder of a worthless check,
like the holder of worthless paper currency, loses.  <sup></sup><p>
<sup></sup>Security in the checking system varies between merchants.  Requiring
proof of identity is standard practice.  Some merchants require testament to
credit worthiness such as credit cards.  A fundamental security mechanism in
the checking system is the existence of criminal penalties for check kiting.
<p>
The problem of interoperability (Kaufman, 1983) in checking accounts has not
been solved; for example, a Pittsburgh family vacationing in Florida may be
unable to cash a check even though demand deposits certainly are a form of
money.  <p>
Checks are divisible in that they can be written for any amount.  A check may
be cashed or exchanged for multiple lower denomination checks.<p>
In the checking system, scalability is provided by check clearing.  Checks do
require central processing; but we are far from the practical limit to scale in
the number of users.  The processing capability of banks is the limiting factor
in the number of users in the checking system.  However the distribution of
liability has provided sufficient motivation for the banks to fulfill their
processing obligations, and assures that when a bank acts slowly the checking
system is not threatened.<a href="usenix_fn.html#fn4">[5]</a>  In the United
States, check clearing also uses the Federal Reserve, at regional check
processing centers, which provide floats and processing.  The price of these
services explains part of the attraction of banks to electronic notational
currency.  <p>

<h2>
3.3
Credit and  Debit Cards: Electronic Transfers of Notational Currency
</h2><p>
With credit and debit cards, the instruction to debit or increment an account
is made electronically.  We include these cards in this section because,
although they may use electronic communication, a physical device is required.
The possession of this physical device is sufficient proof of the holder's
identity and authority to authorize instructions on card's account.  Point of
sale (POS) systems accept credit or debit cards, and charge or debit the
payer's account while crediting the payee.  Other systems simply check to
verify that a card is valid rather than immediately transferring funds.  <p>
Credit and debit cards create records similar to those created by checks,
except the records are machine-readable.  Some content information may also be
recorded with credit and debit cards.  Privacy and anonymity can be compromised
by the ease with which this information is analyzed and distributed.  <p>
Conversely, credit cards can increase privacy by enabling remote transactions.
Physical observers cannot monitor a secure remote transaction.  Electronic
communications can be monitored, however, by electronic observers.  Remote
transactions currently involve credit and debit cards, which create
machine-readable records; but these transactions can theoretically be secure
from casual observers.  For our analysis, we consider an observer who is
electronically well-placed.  In this case, that means the observer can monitor
transmissions between the customer and merchant.  The observer cannot read
encrypted information, but can read all other information.<p>
POS systems provide detailed information about the transaction to merchants and
associated financial institutions, as well as leaking information through
physical observation to an observer.  Because information is obtained by the
bank, it can be available to law enforcement.  Content information may be
recorded by the card issuer, and content information in machine-readable form
may be trivially obtained by the seller.  Information distribution illustrated
in Table 3 (changes from Table 2 are shown in boldface).

Table
3:  Information Available to the Parties In a POS Transaction<p>
Here the "bank" can be replaced by any card issuer.  Most POS transactions send
information over phone lines; however, most POS transmissions (like ATM
transmissions) are encrypted.  Therefore, an electronic observer could only
observe that there are communications between the store and the
clearinghouse.<p>
A credit card transaction is not money-transfer atomic, although it does appear
atomic to the merchant.  That is, the merchant is guaranteed payment by
charging the merchant a percentage of every sale to cover the inevitable
losses.  From the customer's perspective, credit card purchases have a period
in which payment can be canceled, either by the customer's request or by her
not paying her credit card bills.  <p>
Credit card transactions are normally consistent in that the customer and
merchant agree on the amount paid.  (The case of Lyndon LaRouche is a
counter-example to this.)<p>
Credit card transactions are not isolated. There are cases in which a merchant
obtains a block on user credit which is not always promptly erased.  These can
in some cases lead to failure of isolation.<p>
Credit card transactions are durable.  However it may take weeks for a credit
transaction to clear.  <p>
A credit card transaction is limited only by the customer's credit limit.  With
ATM machines, there is a size limit for an individual transaction.  This is to
limit risk, just as the limit on currency denominations limits risk.  However,
this sometimes fails, as the recent theft of over $300,000 with a single card
and access code illustrates (Wells, 1995).  Like checks, credit cards can
support a nearly limitless number of users.<p>
There are limits to interoperability between credit and debit card systems.
You cannot pay your American Express card bill with your VISA, except by first
obtaining cash.<hr>

Case Studies: Electronic Commerce Systems 
</h2><p>
The discussion of credit cards illustrates how electronic systems can increase
data availability and decrease anonymity.  Electronic commerce may exacerbate
this problem.  We discuss two systems which are suitable for transactions over
networks, where there is no physical card or token.  Data surveillance is an
issue in all electronic currency because electronic currency includes
machine-readable records of transactions.  Electronically-stored records can be
retrieved and reviewed with greater ease than printed material.  Ease of the
transmission and distribution of records is increasing with the interconnection
of electronic information systems.  This tends to increase data aggregation,
unauthorized access, intrusion, misuse, and disclosure (Compaine, 1988;
Schoeman, 1992; Hochwald, 1993; Office of Technological Assessment, 1985;
Davies, 1981; Fenner, 1993).  The worst case in terms of data disclosure is an
insecure network with plaintext linked to a unique identifier and overheard by
an electronic eavesdropper.  <p>
Conversely, electronic commerce offers a broader range of privacy
options than traditional physical currency.  Electronic commerce systems can
protect anonymity while providing information necessary for law enforcement.<p>
Electronic currency can offer perfect anonymity, or threaten data surveillance.
Electronic currency offers a broader range of privacy options than physical
systems.  But the theoretically possible is not always practical.  We will
examine two proposed electronic commerce systems: Digicash (Chaum, 1985; Chaum,
1992), and NetBill (Sirbu, 1995).  Both are designed to work in open network
environments.  As we shall see, the technical limitations of these systems, in
some cases, conflict with the desired characteristics noted above.  <p>
We assume that all observers are electronic; that they are well-placed; and
that can view all messages, but can not read encrypted messages without a
decryption key.  <p>

<h2>
4.1
Digicash: Electronic Token Money
</h2><p>
David Chaum's Digicash system addresses the problem of data surveillance in
electronic currency.  In Digicash, parties receive electronic tokens generated
by a bank.  These tokens can be exchanged between two network users, much like
paper currency can.  In some ways, Digicash conforms exactly to the assumptions
underlying cash, anonymous tokens issued by central authorities.  A Digicash
transaction is shown in Figure 1.<p>
How does Digicash stack up against the legal requirements for reporting
monetary transactions? It does no worse than cash.  In particular, the
enforcement of rules such as the requirement to report transactions greater
than $10,000 continue to rely on the cooperation of merchants, as
Digicash-using banks are unable to provide the necessary information.  Digicash
does pose a larger risk in one sense: with Digicash, it is very convenient to
exchange large amounts of money.  This could lead to more large value "cash"
transactions subject to reporting.  Conversely, Digicash also poses a smaller
risk: like cash, tokens must eventually pass through the banking system.  Since
token validity needs to be confirmed by the bank, banks can flag any tokens
valued over $10,000.  Payers must voluntarily provide their identity to the
merchant or the bank.  Identification can be especially problematic in remote
transactions.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="usenix1.gif"><p>
Figure 1: Digicash<p>
How does Digicash stack up against the basic technical requirements
for money expressed in Section 3?  Digicash requires the use of a centralized
server to act as an electronic bank.  This creates a bottleneck, possibly
limiting scale.  On the other hand, there is no limit on the size of individual
transactions, since it is easy to electronically transmit many tokens or to
generate tokens that have high value.  <p>
Before presenting tokens to the bank for verification, the recipient modifies
them to disguise the identities of the customer (previous holders of the token
are already disguised.) In this way, Digicash provides anonymity: only the
customer and the merchant know the identities of the parties engaging in a
transaction.  <p>
There is a fundamental difficulty in the exchange of electronic tokens:
electronic messages can always be trivially duplicated.  Electronic currency
cannot depend on physical means to make tokens difficult to counterfeit.  To
handle this problem, Digicash requires the merchant receiving an electronic
token to quickly present that token to the electronic bank for verification, or
to risk having a worthless token.  This means that Digicash requires network
reliability and availability to maintain integrity.  <p>
The information available to the parties in a Digicash transaction is shown in
Table 4.  (Items in boldface differ from Table 1, since cash is the
corresponding physical currency.) Partial identity information trapped by the
observer and the seller result from IP address transmission<p>

Transaction<p>
Digicash's counterfeit-preventing techniques rely on several
assumptions about the complexity of certain cryptographic.  Under these widely
accepted assumptions, Digicash is secure against counterfeiting.  <p>
Digicash also relies on assumptions about the privacy of cryptographic keys.
These assumptions are problematic.  In practice, it seems unreasonable to
assume that cryptographic keys can always be kept private at electronic banks.
Just as physical banks can not prevent occasional embezzlements, it seems
reasonable to assume that Digicash banks can not always protect cryptographic
keys.  Thus, the question becomes: What damage results when the bank's private
key is disclosed? An adversary who gains access to a cryptographic key can
generate counterfeit tokens that are indistinguishable from valid tokens.
These tokens can be generated in any amount desired, so compromise of the key
compromises all tokens in circulation.  <p>
Digicash transfers are not money-atomic.  (This was also noted by Yee. (Yee, 94))
If a transfer of Digicash tokens (step 4 in Figure 1) is interrupted, then it
is possible that both or neither party may believe it has legitimate access to
the token.  The customer may attempt to resolve this state by canceling the
token (by cashing it in), but if the merchant also does this, the result is a
race condition.  (This also violates consistency and isolation).  Since
Digicash cannot reveal who cashed in a token when a merchant claims that he did
not cash in the token, and the customer claims that the merchant did; dispute
resolution can be a problem. <p>
This could be resolved by having the bank log the identities of individuals and
which tokens they have cashed in, but this would violate the Digicash anonymity
model.  The use of intermediaries could provide identity masking between buyer
and seller, thus providing logging for the bank and maintaining anonymity.  The
result is shown in Table 5. Items in italics show the changes from Table 4
which result from using intermediaries; in boldface the information made
available as a result of logging.

4.2
NetBill: Electronic Notational Money</h2><p>
 NetBill is an electronic notational money system.  In NetBill, parties write
authorizations to exchange money analogous to checks.  These authorizations
must be presented to a bank; as with checks, they may need to be exchanged
among several distributed banks.  Each authorization is digitally signed and
numbered, so counterfeiting requires key disclosure.  See Figure 2 for an
illustration of a transaction using NetBill.  Steps 5-7 are digitally signed.<p>
How does NetBill stack up against the basic technical requirements for money?
NetBill uses distributed servers.  It is an on-line system, and requires
real-time response.  Therefore, the integrity of the NetBill system depends on
network reliability and availability and its scalability is limited.  <p>
 On the other hand, because the system is distributed, it will tend to be
robust and can be extended to handle arbitrary more transactions by using
multiple NetBill servers.  <p>
NetBill transactions are fully ACID.  In fact, NetBill satisfies goods-transfer
atomicity for information goods because these goods are transferred encrypted.
A cryptographic checksum of the encrypted goods is registered at the NetBill
server after customer and merchant certification.  The decryption key for the
goods is registered with the NetBill server by the merchant.  Transaction
clearing is tied to the successful registration of the checksum and decryption
key.  <p>
<p>
<IMG SRC = "usenix2.gif"><p>
Figure 2:  NetBill<p>
If the customer does not receive the decryption key (step 8 in Figure 2) then
the customer can request it from the NetBill server.  If the goods have been
misrepresented, a customer can dispute the transaction using the checksum of
the goods and the decryption key registered at the NetBill server.<p>
The integrity of NetBill rests on a number of complexity assumptions, as well
as on assumptions about the security of NetBill servers.  As with the case of
Digicash, the former assumptions are generally accepted, but the latter
assumptions should be carefully examined.  <p>
What damage will result if NetBill servers are violated?  In the short term the
server could move money between accounts.  However, because NetBill and the
parties involved log all transactions and have signed receipts, it would be
possible to reconstruct bogus transactions.

Table
6:  Information Available to the Parties In a NetBill Transaction<p>
How does NetBill stack up against the legal requirements for disclosing
information about money?  NetBill keeps a record of all transactions, so it is
easy to comply with reporting regulations.  NetBill normally provides no
anonymity since users are identified to merchants and NetBill can trace
transactions.  The anonymity provided by NetBill is shown in Table 6.  Since
NetBill is an electronic notational system, the items in boldface are those
that differ from a checking transaction. There are no legal constraints on
customer and merchant data dissemination by NetBill ; or on the dissemination
of data about customers by merchants.  Boldface entries indicate a difference
from Table 2 because NetBill transactions are based on the model of a check.<p>
It is possible to boost the privacy of a NetBill transaction by using
intermediary agents.  Customer information can be transmitted through
agents<sup>, </sup>which encrypt the origin of the message and then send it
forward to the seller.  The seller delivers the requested good through the
agent.  This is described in Figure 3 (Cox, 1994).  It shows only one agent,
but several can be used.  <p>
<IMG SRC="usenix3.gif"><p>
Figure 3.  Use of Intermediate Agents<p>
Mutual anonymity can be provided with the use of an additional agent for the
seller.  However, in all cases the NetBill server knows the identity of the
parties and the amount of the transaction.  Thus NetBill provides only limited
privacy.  (The NetBill server doesn't need to know the object purchased. This
information can be hidden using a variety of simply hidden by any number of cryptographic techniques:  public key
encryption, private key encryption, hashing, etc.) The information known to
parties in a privacy-enhanced version of NetBill is shown in Table 7, with the
changes from Table 6 in boldface.

5 Conclusions
</h2><p>
 All physical currency has innate anonymity losses due to the possibility of
physical observation.  Any merchant or observer can narrow the range of
possible customer identities by simply looking at the customer!  However,
disclosure of information so obtained is limited by the relative difficulty of
recording the data, and of physical, as opposed to data, surveillance.  Thus in
a cash economy, record creation can be costly and difficult.  Many current
government rules obligate parties in a cash transaction to create records so
that the government can gather necessary information.  Because data collection
is inherently difficult, there was little need to put in place laws limiting
data surveillance of transactions.<p>
Modern electronic transactions transferring notational currency usually require
the production of machine-readable records.  Machine-readable records can
easily be aggregated or distributed.  These records are typically stored for
extended periods, creating a hazard to privacy through inadvertent or
deliberate disclosure.  <p>
As notational currency in the form of demand deposits, checks, and later, debit
cards have become the predominant means of exchange, record creation has become
more automatic and the resulting electronic records more prone to data
surveillance.  The government has taken advantage of the ease of record
creation and processing with notational currency to impose additional record
keeping and reporting requirements on banks and individuals.  These records
create a potential problem of data surveillance, and regulations to limit
surveillance have not kept pace.  <p>
Participant anonymity in transactions involving notational currency is possible
through the use of intermediaries, including anonymity of the user to the
merchant, anonymity of the user to the financial services provider, anonymity
of the merchant to the user, anonymity of the merchant to the financial
services provider, and any combination of these (Low, 1993).  Conversely,
observation of transactions involving notational currency can be more difficult
than for cash transactions, since face-to-face exchange is not necessary.  <p>
Electronic tokens may also provide seller anonymity, since these transactions
no longer require a store front or postal address.  Anonymity of the seller to
the customer can provide perfect price discrimination.  This is particularly
useful for blind bidding, by simplifying the process and decreasing the
opportunity for bribes and kickbacks.  With this anonymity, companies could
obtain discounts from reliable merchants (which could identify the customers)
without the purchaser knowing the seller.  However, without appropriate
record-keeping this creates a fraud hazard.<p>
Mutual anonymity between the service provider and the user is possible in both
physical and electronic systems through the use of intermediaries.  However, in
physical transactions one must put full trust in the intermediaries not to
alter the transaction or abscond with the cash, whereas in electronic systems
it is possible through the use of cryptographic protocols to preserve anonymity
and prevent transaction alteration by intermediaries.<p>
New technologies, such as Digicash or NetBill, offer possibilities for
increased privacy and anonymity in electronic monetary transactions.
Digicash's promise of very high levels of anonymity are problematic, however,
because such completely anonymous transactions are subject to statutory
prohibition under various laws and regulations.  We have also argued that
meeting other technical requirements such as robustness would require
record-keeping by participants that would also undermine the promised anonymity
of Digicash.  <hr>

 Appendix: Reporting Requirements
</h2><p>
Statutory reporting requirements have been developed to address problems of the
intrinsic anonymity of token currency.  These reporting requirements define the
minimum auditing requirements for a currency system.  In this appendix we
consider both specific examples of reporting requirements and the general
techniques used for reporting requirements.<p>
Financial reporting requirements are necessary for a wide array of reasons,
including tax collection, other law enforcement, social management, and tracing
specific products (including stocks, weapons, and automobiles).  Yet for all
the differences in intent, these requirements use four basic data gathering
techniques: immediate reporting, detailed record-keeping, periodic reporting,
and periodic aggregate reporting.  Following is an example of each.<p>
An <i>immediate reporting</i> requirement was initiated by the 1988 Money
Laundering Act which empowered the Treasury to require that all suspicious
transaction be recorded.  The Treasury interpreted this to require reporting of
all cash transactions above $10,000 and all purchases of financial instruments
(such as traveler's checks) over $3,000.  All $10,000 transactions must be
reported by all merchants, using the appropriate forms, to the Treasury.
Whether this will apply to all businesses that accept electronic transfers of
money has yet to be determined; however, here we assume it will continue to
apply to all consumer transactions.  Currently a prompt report is legally
required from all businesses, although the definition of "prompt" varies
between types of businesses.  <p>
The Money Laundering Act extended the provision of the Bank Secrecy Act.  The
Bank Secrecy Act, despite its name, actually requires <i>detailed
record-keeping</i>.  It was passed to assure law enforcement access to detailed
records of personal financial transactions under subpoena rather than privacy
to patrons.  The Bank Secrecy Act requires that financial institutions maintain
records of all transactions over $100 for at least five years.  Note the Bank
Secrecy Act requires not only that records are in plaintext, but even requires
that the record be an image of the bank's records of the transactions, such as
a copy of the check (12 USC Sec.1829d).  <p>
The most common <i>periodic data reporting</i> requirement is the annual
individual tax filing on April 15.  Wages, tips, and other forms of income must
be reported to the federal, state and local governments as necessary for tax
purposes.  Expenditures can be reported according to taxpayer preference.  That
the increased record keeping possible in notational currency systems would be
effective in preventing fraud is suggested by the thousands of dependents that
disappeared from the tax roles as soon as their Social Security Numbers were
required.<p>
The Community Reinvestment Act requires <i>periodic aggregate data
reporting</i>.  The Act requires financial institutions make credit and
depository services available to all the neighborhoods in their service area on
an equitable basis.  Regulatory bodies (the Comptroller of Currency, the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Depository Insurance
Corporation, and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board The Comptroller of Currency,
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Depository
Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board) are responsible
for specifying the necessary reporting requirements to verify compliance.
Typically this means loan application aggregates sorted by ethnicity of the
borrower, neighborhood, or loan amount.  Specific data requirements vary over
time, states, and even between institutions.  <p>
Statutes may prohibit as well as require reporting; for example, the Fair
Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) placed statutory limits on disclosure.  The FCRA
prevents the disclosure of investigative consumer reports, and requires
disclosure of credit reports only to those with a legitimate business need.
The FCRA also requires disclosure to the consumer on demand.  The FCRA requires
accuracy in all records by empowering consumers to examine and correct their
records.  However, this offers limited protection because the courts have ruled
that these limits apply only to credit reporting agencies, not to banks or
insurance companies.  <p>
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) is another statutory limitation on data
recording and dissemination.  The ECOA also requires some disclosure and
prohibits some data gathering.  Specifically, the ECOA prohibits inquiries
about martial status, thereby preventing the collection of this data.  The ECOA
also requires recording joint account activity in the records of all parties on
the account.  The ECOA applies to all companies that offer consumer credit and
maintain credit records.<p>
Public sector data gathering and disclosure is more tightly constrained than
similar private sector activities.  Disclosure of financial records of
individuals obtained by the government is limited by the Financial Privacy Act
and the Fourth Amendment.  Data transfers between federal agencies are
unregulated.  <p>
The previous examples are not an exhaustive set in terms of identification of
reporting requirements; however, they illustrate the techniques used to obtain
or prohibit data recording and disclosure.  <hr>
