<strong><u>Introduction.</u>
</strong>This document summarizes a research activity currently underway
 at Sandia National Laboratories. The purpose of this research effort is
 to extend Probabilistic Risk Analysis (PRA) methods to network security
 and vulnerability analysis.  PRA methods are uniquely able to measure 
the importance of particular components or events to overall risk.  
Thus, we are hopeful that PRA methods, combined with a systematic 
modeling approach, can provide insights that can help design networks 
which are more inherently resistant to known methods of attack.

<strong><u>Technical Problem.</u></strong>Current network security 
approaches require "friendly adversaries" to identify and mitigate 
system vulnerabilities before "real" adversaries can find and exploit 
them.  Realistically, this approach is an art form typically practiced 
on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. It relies heavily on the network security 
analyst's expertise to find potential network vulnerabilities and 
understand all of the possible ramifications that might occur should the
 vulnerability be exploited.  Currently there is no disciplined 
systematic analysis approach that can be used by persons with limited 
expertise in risk assessment or vulnerability analysis to (1) examine 
how an adversary might be able to exploit identified weaknesses in order
 to perform undesirable activities, and (2) assess the universe of 
undesirable activities that an adversary could accomplish given that 
they were able to enter the network using an identified weakness.</font></p><p><font face="CG Times">
<strong><u>Technical Approach.</u></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically 
there has been minimal cross-pollination between the areas of 
vulnerability assessment (which includes risk and reliability analysis 
techniques such as probabilistic risk assessment, or PRA, as well as 
vital area analysis) and network assessment. Over the past few years, 
research at Sandia and elsewhere has demonstrated that PRA techniques 
can be used to help understand the potential for failure in various 
types of information system components.  Within the last year, these 
methods have also been proven capable of modeling connectivity, classes 
of network traffic, and the provision of network services for both 
hierarchical and non-hierarchical networks.  Our current research effort
 involves extending these demonstrated PRA methods to enhance current 
network security analysis techniques.  The objective of the project is 
to develop a method by which a network analyst with minimal formal PRA 
training could assemble a valid risk model.  This would allow them to 
assess the vulnerability of their network to known attack methods that 
had been systematically cataloged by experts and incorporated into PRA 
sub-models.
</font></p><p><font face="CG Times">
The project will make use of a three-pronged methodology.  The first 
prong of our approach will seek to categorize known vulnerabilities and 
attack methods according to the types of network components that are 
susceptible and the <i>immediate</i> damage that can be done to the 
information system as a result of this compromise.  We will then select 
which risk assessment methods will be the most appropriate for the types
 of systems and scenarios to be modeled, and seek to capture these 
vulnerabilities for appropriate classes of network components in small 
risk sub-models in much the same way as was done under the modular fault
 tree project in the mid-1980s for generic classes of nuclear reactor 
components and, as has been done more recently under another study, for 
typical failure modes in certain classes of network components. This set
 of risk sub-models will represent a systematic cataloging of 
vulnerabilities and attack methods, will serve as a data repository 
created by both risk and networking experts that can be used later by 
network analysts with minimal formal PRA training to assemble a valid 
risk model.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Issues:</b></u> The dynamic nature of 
certain processes and vulnerabilities within information systems may 
make it difficult to adequately characterize some classes of 
vulnerabilities.  This is especially true for some types of attacks 
against cryptographically protected systems.
</font></p><p><font face="CG Times">
The second prong of our approach will work to develop the thought 
processes and modeling methodologies that are required to examine how an
 adversary might be able to gain access to either data or services that 
need to be protected. This will be based on a risk assessment 
methodology such as influence diagrams or fault tree analysis which can 
systematically and deductively "reach out" from the identified 
undesirable event to determine its immediate causes, its intermediate 
causes, and eventually, its ultimate causes.  The method would be 
expected to be capable of considering natural threats (<i>e.g.</i>, flooding of equipment facilities) and normal equipment failures as well as person-made threats (<i>e.g.</i>,
 adversary attacks), from on-site and off-site sources, both 
independently and in combination with anthropogenic threats, because 
each might alter the probability of success during an attack.  The 
objective of this method would be to allow a network analyst to make 
direct and rapid use of the expert-developed sub-models described 
previously to create a credible risk model to enumerate the various 
types of attacks that could be launched against the data or service that
 we are seeking to protect.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Issues:</b></u> The use of 
deductive models for large systems can produce very large risk models 
that are difficult to solve or gain insights from.  This can be 
mitigated by the use of surrogates for classes or groups of components.
</font></p><p><font face="CG Times">
The third prong of our approach will develop methods and thought 
processes to help an analyst understand the universe of undesirable 
activities that an adversary could accomplish given that they were able 
to enter the network using an identified weakness.  In other words, an 
adversary may originally try to enter our information system with one 
goal in mind.  Once inside the system, however, he may decide to "wander
 around" and see what else he can find.  Where he can wander and what he
 can get into will differ depending upon how he initially entered the 
system.  On the other hand, gaining some low level of access may serve 
as a stepping stone in an attack scenario for an intruder to be able to 
gain some higher privileges and continue the attack. Our method to gain 
understanding of the possible ramifications of a security breach will be
 based on a risk assessment methodology that supports inductive 
reasoning such as event trees or influence diagrams (note that both of 
these methods easily interface with the deductive methods that are to be
 used for the second prong of our approach).  Once again, the objective 
is to allow a network analyst to create a credible risk model without 
having to become a risk assessment expert.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><b>Issues:</b></u>
 These models seem to be more closely dependent on the individual system
 being modeled than the deductive models described above, so it is 
unclear whether the expert-developed sub-models will be of much 
assistance in this area.  However, automated security gaming techniques 
may provide an additional solution avenue in this area.  Also, this 
problem may approach combinatorial expansion, so we may need to either 
find or develop new mathematical algorithms to reduce this expansion to a
 manageable level.

<strong><u>Expected Results.</u></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This project will 
produce three types of results: (1) Risk sub-models (to represent a 
systematic cataloging of vulnerabilities and attack methods) for the 
generic classes of network components, and a more complete demonstration
 for a few specific components and a detailed methodology for generating
 sub-models for additional components; (2) A feasibility assessment and a
 detailed modeling methodology for both the deductive risk problem and 
the inductive risk problem described previously, along with a series of 
solved demonstration problems that exercise and illuminate the methods; 
and (3) A plan for automating the methodologies developed under the 
project, including high-level software requirements for a 
production-oriented analysis tool, and an examination of existing risk 
assessment software for compatibility with the methods developed for 
this project (specialized prototype or proof-of-concept software may be 
developed under this project to assist in the solution of the 
demonstration problems, but the development of production software is 
beyond the scope of this project).<br></font><br><br><br></p>
