Jean Camp, www.ljean.net/FC01notes.html, March 1, 2001. </font><h1>Financial cryptography 2001</h1><FONT FACE="Times"> <P>These notes are from the morning session of Financial Cryptography 2001 in   The Cayman Islands in the British West Indies. My sometimes-relevent asides   are in italitcs. </P><P>The conference refelected both a field that was coming of age and an academic   area that is getting entangled in the nasty interdisicplinary world. Issues   of computation efficiency, device capacities, implementation in real world financial   systems, and risk management were all addressed. Although I did not count I   would guess something more than 100 attendees. Because the conference is front-loaded,   that is the morning sessions are academic and the afternoon sessions are commercial,   the attendence at the earliest sessions was highest.</P><P>The afternoon sessions were vendor sessions. You can go to their sites to check   out what the vendors say for themselves. The sponsers were <a href="www.ncipher.com">nCipher</a>,   <a href="http://www.bibit.com">Bibit</a>, <a href="http://www.intertrust.com">Intertrust</a>,   <a href="http://www.hush.com">Hush</a> , <a href="http://www.zeroknowledge.com">Zero Knowledg</a>e,   <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a>, <a href="http://www.certco.com">CertCo</a>, <a href="http://www.certico.com">CertiCom</a>,   <a href="http://www.rsa.com">RSA</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>. </P><P>As in all conferences the value is in the dialogue as much as the presentations.   I did not review my paper, for obvious reasons, the slides are at <A href=http://www.ljean.org/files/FC01.html> http://www.ljean.org/files/FC01.html</a>.   However, I also did not review the paper immediately before mine, as I was quite   busy tensing up. </P><P>There were two non-crypto papers. There was one paper on analysis of trust   from difference disciplinary perspectives (mine) and one paper on analyzing   the cost of MicroMint. I wonder if the financial privacy laws happen in the   US if some of the papers next year may be on regulatory compliance. </P><h2>MONDAY FEB 19 </h2><P>The first paper was<B> Amortized E-cash</B> by Moses Liskov and Silvio Micali   at MIT. Moses presented it. </P><P>Okamoto was the first to offer a proposal for divisible e-cash, and is used   by the authors as the basis for comparison of their own coinage. In addition   to past work on divisible e-cash, there has been much work to create definitions   for the requirements for divisible e-cash. In this case the authors developed   the requirements and worked from there. </P><P>The core idea was to amortize expensive crypto operations over multiple coins   by dividing the coin into two two parts. The goal is provide cash that is both   off-line and anonymous. Off-line implies double spending, so identity is embedded   in the coin. Spent once, anonymous, spent twice identity is released. The basic   idea is that two expenditures create two equasions, thus solving for identity. </P><P>Embedding identity requires uses zero knowledge protocol. However, zero knowledge   protocols are expensiove. Consider the cost when $100=10,000cents</P><P>Coins from one wallet can be linked to coins with other wallets. Models the   identity lost under a single wallet on the conceptual model of a single ATM   transaction. Anonymity is lessened because the wallet becomes a pseudonym. Each   wallet has a single wallet-defining subcoin. Authenticated by bank, includes   user&#146;s identity, specifies all coins. </P><P>Wallet is a Merkle hash tree. Root &amp; depth defines coins. Wallet of depth   d has 2^d subcoins. Common subcoin is the root. </P><P>Each coin is an ephemeral k, or commitment. Common subcoin includes root, depth,   PK, Ek(identity). Essentially core for double spending is Schnorr signature   which exposes the signed identity by exposing the key when there are two transactions   using the same subcoin (which is a subcoin-specific key). The existence of two   transactions and the shared wallet/coin that contains identity.</P><P>Q&amp; A argues that the contribution of this paper is not primarily efficiency   given the ZK protocol but rather off-line divisible coins with strict security   assumptions. Moses agrees. The questions were rather pointed.</P><P>The second paper was<B> Offline payments without trusted hardware </B>by Matt   Blaze, John Ioannidis, Angelos Keromytis (ATT, ATT, Upenn)] presented by Angelos   Keromytis. </P><P>The design decisions began with a single observation: avoid hardware because   trusted hardware fails catastrophically. When it is broken, all the wallets   are broken.</P><P>As opposed to concentrating risk, distribute risk in an appropriate per-transaction   manner. Tolerate and manage risks of bad transactions. Use credentials to encode   risk management. User has credential, which encodes risk profile. Assumes occasional   communication for credential validation but does not require constant connectivity. </P><P>In order the create a reasonable level of risk management the maximum value   is low (e.g. $1.25) and credentials are short-lived. So there is no CRL rather   risk management is embedded with credential extension. The authors argue that   this is not unlike the credit system.</P><P>This is based on the keynote microcheck system developed by Upenn and AT&amp;T.   Based on a Trust Management Language. Claims other systems require their own   clearance systems, <i>although this was not the case with NetBill or FirstVirtual,   or any early aggregator</i>. </P><P>Payments are vendor-specific microchecks. Vendors aggregate. Vendor determines   how much risk to accept. Keynote compliance system is the vendor-specific risk-management   mechanism that requires that the vendor manage his or her own risks.</P><P>Compared to newspaper stands, where there is little theft. Implemented on a   Palm with a PocariSweat machine using a Linux PC as merchant hardware and ssl   port, gnu utilities on Palm hardware under Linux. </P><P>Billing or clearing service must have pre-existing relationship by payers.   Note that AT&amp;T would be a good party for billing given their micro-billing   transactions. In order to support this the central party would have clearance,   party fees, or transaction percent. </P><P>No claims on anonymity.</P><P><i>The work of Ian Simpson isn't referenced but could inform their implementation   IMHO. <A name="ian">Ian's paper, Modeling the Risks and Costs of Digitally Signed   Certificates in Electronic Commerce</a>is at <A href= http://www.ini.cmu.edu/NETBILL/pubs/certlife/certlife.html>http://www.ini.cmu.edu/NETBILL/pubs/certlife/certlife.html.   </a></i></P><P>The next paper was one of two non-crypto papers. This paper was focused on   order of magnitude caluculations which examined the possibility of a trial Microcmint,<B>   Practical Problems for Building a MicroMint</B> by Nicko van Someren of www.ncipher.com</P><P>Someren is the CTO of a company that is trying to implement secure hardware   and argues that the economics of MicroMint make it impossible to introduce because   you can scale up but not down.</P><P>As you may recall, using the birthday paradox MicroMint uses coins that are   hash collisions. Minting is cost &#151;effective because of great economies   of scale. Extra criteria can be added, so the scheme can be n-way hash. Coins   have a life span based on the work factor of the has collision. Once spending   begins anyone can mint coins but it takes time, and the bank has a head start. </P><P> &quot;It is traditional at this conference to present an e-cash scheme so   I thought I would make one up&quot;. (but doesn&#146;t offers secure hardware)</P><P>Not anonymous. Double spending is tolerable because of very low value transactions   and rather traditional risk-management schemes. </P><P>Problem: dirty money is cheap. Business model is spending false money while   banks are living off interest and fees. Argues that attackers have far more   money, but Moore&#146;s Law helps the attacker. So Someren argues that in fact   the attacker can produce fraudulent cash because a borderline attack, including   Moore&#146;s law Argues that for the system for function effectively the initial   investment will be about $100M. MicroMint scales up but not down. </P><P>Paper in the proceeding argues you need dozens of floor to ceiling racks and   uses .5 megawatt of electricity to create hash engine. 10,000 sq.-ft.. then   sorting the hash requires .25 terabyte of storage and then sort it. Scales up   but not down.</P><P>Basically only a government could do it. In general argues that assumptions   were cryptographically valid at the time (six yrs ago) given hardware costs.   Thus MicroMint is not feasible today. The need for massive scale in MicroMint   makes this system far more expensive. However he neglects the secret predicate   option. His focus that a system must be able to function in small prototype.   Digital signatures allow this. He proposes using secure hardware since it is   easier to scale up. </P><P>The next section was a panel on <B>Digital Rights Management</B> which was   chaired by Yair Frankel who argues the keys to DRM are efficacy, customer acceptance,   and diffusion.</P><B> <P>David Kravits, WAVE</P></B> <P>Management of conditional Access keys</P><UL>  <LI> requires compliance of set-top box (STB)</LI></UL><UL>  <LI>assume CAM is good and STB is compliant, then the flow from STB to monitor     is unencrypted</LI></UL><UL>  <LI>proposed enforced licensing STB as legislative solution, forced compliance     and make content inaccessible with non-compliant STB</LI>  <LI>require phone-home</LI></UL><P>Wave is concerned with set-top boxes where consumers make multiple content   copies. CAM not only determines what consumers watch but must &quot;log attacks&quot;.   Proposes that only compliant monitors are allowed. </P><P>Pirates may not be backward compatible but those who offer consumer hardware   must be. (This is a bit ironic given that the speaker advocates only allowing   content to go into compliant monitors.) </P><P>Consolidated hardware deployment offers the opportunity to replace point solutions   by shared solutions and preserve user privacy yet handle revocation.</P><B> <P>Barb Fox: Microsoft Web TV</P></B> <P>No one has been deterred by the total historical failure of detailed controls.   At least three competing DRM standards: W3C, CableLabs Thuis DRM is a life form   which is amazingly resiliant. &lt;/humor&gt;</P><P>Conditional access currently consist of a massive number of supplication-specific   systems including Digital RM systems, black box crypto</P><P>Barbara suggests that the problem with digital information is that there is   a completely immature risk model. Where in physical or analog systems the risk   model is mature.</P><P>The stakeholders have completely differeent design parameters. First industry   want authentication, encryption, renewable, revocable. However for there to   be widespread adoption the system must be coherent, cheap, privacy, and use   rational risk-mgt. Finally for efficaicy the system must be robust, scalable,   and support flexible decentralized mgt.<B> </B></P><B> <P>Jeremy Wyant: Ntru</P></B> <P>Device-based systems are what he proposes. He sells a toolkit. </P><P>He provided an overview of the possible set of technologies: watermarking,   fingerprinting, encryption, authentication, network scanning, fees on blank   media, and an honor system . He agreed with/repeated/expanded on what Barb said,   in detail, e.g. flexibility in terms of computability and ease of use. </P><P>Proposes that a minimalist DRM on trusted devices that is supported by a critical   mass of content providers would be widely adopted. </P><P><B> Thomas Sander </B>of Intertrust </P><P>DRM is dynamic in both business model and technology. </P><P>The current goals is convenient anytime anywhere accesses to your music.</P><P>The ultimate goal is to try to tie the right of use of content to a particular   person. Thomas proposes lockers which track what you have rights to access,   argues that portability is the core current technical challenge.</P><P>Usability is terrible. However, second generation products are improving. Must   be backward compatible. </P><P>Strong legal protection will protect DRM investment because there is no way   to run a legitimate business using copyrighted content on the net without consent   of rights holders. OTOH, technology companies influence content strategies.</P><P>NCa: Southern Ca doesn&#146;t get it</P><P>SCa: Yes but we already Have It, and to get content on-line you have to play   our way.</P><P>Loss management needs to be a critical element. Consider that in Pay TV most   protection schemes have been broken but there is still plenty of money to be   made. In DVD there was no proven monetary damage, in terms of crypto it was   broken but in terms of business DVD still works. </P><P>He suggested that versioning is not like QoS, as it exist in the net access   market. If you could combine ease of use with Napster with fidelity that commercial   service can provide people are willing to pay for it.</P><P>Audit v privacy is a major research issue. Intertrust has deployed technology   with Universal, BNG, and Bertelsmann. Learned that the shopping cart model works   better than the wallet model in US. In Europe the wallet model works better.</P><P>Conclusion: economics is on the side of digital distribution and the technology   for adequate DRM already exists.</P><B> <P>Scott Moslowitz, BlueSpike</P></B> <P>Scott starts by saying his has very different views. Advocates stenographic   ciphers with traditional encryption. Believes that artist should sign work,   and then trace and bust the thieves. </P><P>There are two different risk models. The current concept of DRM is pay before   viewing. In constrast watermarking models a "look and then pay or we trace you".</P><P>Market note: 10 movies account for 90% of store revenue and 83 recordings provide   25% of sales. This implies that under the current blockbuster model DRM could   focus on very few titles. Soctt belives the highly skewed blockbuster model   is a result of fre consumer choice not market strucutre and that this distribution   will continue on the net. </P><P>Argues that consumers advocate DRM that &#145;reduces value&#146;; fair use   and first sale are culturally ingrained and reasonable. He believes in risk   Mt but calls it balancing copyright and privacy. Security system must first   add value and then do no harm. </P><P>Audience: I am disturbed by this discussion. DRM is not a technological problem.   DRM takes away rights like Fair Use</P><P>Audience: How to balance rights and detecting infraction vs. anonymity and   privacy. </P><P>Joan Feigenbaum: There is an unstable bubbling legal cauldron. The whole challenge   is not technology or law but rather business. </P><P>The panel agrees. (DRM is narrow and economically deterministic.) </P><P>Audience: Napster allows you to find music on the harddrive of someone who   has similar interests. Napster allows consumers to be dj&#146;s etc. Napster   allows customers to listen first. Napster has radically incresed CD sales. Scott:   Napster has radically reduced singles sales. </P><P>Matt Blaze suggests that those who would remove fair use and first sale through   technology lose the social bargain of copyright. David suggests that putting   the ball in the owner&#146;s courts. </P><P>Thomas: It is not the lack of DRM -- it is the content owners. The content   owners are making plenty of money and are not interested in cannibalization   of their own business model. DRM is just an excuse or attempt to keep business   models unchanged. </P><h2>TUESDAY FEB 20</h2><P>The first session is on Groups and Anonymity. Stuart acknowledges that this   was kind of an umbrella session, of good papers that need not necessarily be   grouped together. </P><P>Group authentication protocol: prove one belongs to a group without revealing   identity. Requires the following steps:</P><UL>  <UL>    <LI>Setup: an authority chooses parameters</LI>    <LI>Registration: a user becomes a member of a group w/ or w/o revealing identity     </LI>    <LI>Anonymous authentication: anonymous certificate </LI>  </UL></UL><ul>  Properties:   <li>Completeness: works with honest players   <li>Soundness: only group members can be authenticated   <li>Anonymity: non-revocable anonymity   <li>Efficiency: less strong requirement </ul><P>Biblio:F C 99: Shechter, Parnell, Hartemink and FC 00: Handley</P><P>I however think that the work of Brands provides the ability to prove group   membership. But that is a general expensive solution and this may be a cheaper   specific solution.<br>  Setup: p, g generator, u public constant <br>  z,w private keys of authority <br>  v=u<SUP>w</SUP> mod (p-1) <br>  User data: <br>  User secret key x <br>  User public y=g<SUP>x</SUP> mod p <br>  Keys are used for other applications to prevent users handing off anonymous   membership <br>  Registration <br>  Authority chooses a in space of g <br>  Authority computer <br>  a1=(gy<SUP>z</SUP>)<SUP>a</SUP> mod p <br>  a2=a <SUP>w</SUP> mod (p-1) </P><P>User now has a certificate (a1, a2). User can prove she knows discrete log.   You can use Schnorr or zero knowledge protocol to prove this.</P><P>Criticisms of Homage in the paper. </P><P>Suppose a user knows n,m such that using m=n<SUP>z</SUP> mod p. Then such a   user can construct a valid, bogus, proof of membership. The user can obtain   the zth root of some number m by constructing her challenge in verification   of soundness. A solution is proposed. (Sending hash of verification, rather   than verification which is zth root of m)</P><P>Authority can break anonymity by using different secret keys z to computer   certificates and then distinguish users during authentication. In order to avoid   this it is necessary to avoid verification. The author proposes a new mechanism   using zero knowledge proofs for verification. </P><P>Audience member argues that protocol is not completely broken. In fact, audience   member argues that all the flaws found and fixed in the protocol were found   and fixed last year. Is the protocol broken or going through normal iterative   improvement? The first paper was On the Security of the Homage Group Authentication   Protocol. This paper was presented, and accepted at a previous FC when the author   was a high school student. Both respect and concern for a young collegaue resulting   in somewhat harsh questioning.</P><P>The next paper was<b> Anonymity without Cryptography </b>by Dahlia Malkhi and   Elan Pavlov, and Dahlia presented it. This was an excellent presentation.<B>   </B>Crypto-free communication assuming secure channels using Anonymous Multi-Party   Computation uses Chaums mixnets.</P><P>Really it is with less crypto (as Dahlia notes first thing in talk). This would   allow use with pervasive devices with low processing power. No infrastructure   required.</P><P>There are fairly secure channels use without crypto &#151; e.g. regular mail.   The initial secure channel assumption is only needed to bootstrap the protocol.   Also, there already exist SSL connections so this requires no additional infrastructure   after initial communication between users. </P><P>Describes mixes, which is effectively onion routing with the removal of timing   attacks. Of course onion routing/mixing requires multiple public key encryption. </P><P>As opposed to encryption the messages are broken into shares and the initial   shares are sent as elements. At each level message values are split and remerge.   So any function used must be homomorphic. F(a%b) = F(a) % F(b) where % ={+,   *, xor,&#133;} Thus it is restrictive but practical. </P><P>Like this:<br>  Initiator and recipient agree on permutation and function <br>  Initiator: m = (x1), (x2) <br>  Sends the tuples as distinct messages <br>  Second layer performs permutation (y1, y2) <br>  Recipient receives (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and can calculate m <br>  The goal here was the creation of a new primitive. Its main practical feature   is that it requires no heavy calculation of the client. This is a building block   for various security applications, perhaps ideal for wireless environments. </P><P>Then <B>Fair tracing Without Trustees</B> by Dennis Kugler and Holger Vogt   was presented. </P><P>A protocol which provides coin tracing without owner tracing. Goals of protocol   are:</P><br>Legal tracing: tracing is legal if approved by judge <br>Illegal tracing: illegal if not approved by judge <br>Fair tracing: if legal tracing is possible but illegal tracing is not <P>In order to enable this tracing is detectable after the fact. Therefore if   illegal tracing has occurred it is detectable, traceable is auditing and illegal   tracing is provable. </P><P>Decision to trace coins must be made at generation of coins. After the coin   is spent the validation of the coin both implements and identifies coin tracing.   Gross generalization: the coin is generated with a second key, x= a <SUP>PKB</SUP>   (mod p) as opposed to PK<SUB>B</SUB>(mod p). No additional trusted parties that   hold sensitive data. The goal is to build in later auditing rather than long   term trust. (Generally what is done in terms of governance today.)</P><P>Audience has mixed feelings. Is tracable anonymity anonymity? </P><B> <P>Why the War on Money Laundering should be Aborted</P></B> <P>This was the big event talk by Richard Rahn. </P><P>Right wing rant about money laundering which focuses primarily on the drug   war,<i> since the drug war is such an exercise that could be called ludicrious   it it were not so relentlessly cruel</i>. Rahn is a Pepperdine School honorary   doctorate. Opposed to money laundering controls. Notes the political spectrum   agress with im, defines it as all the way from the Cato Institute to the Enterprise   Institute. Invites all to join him in his plan-free goal to end contols on money   laundering. He has a book out, <A href= http://www.liberty-tree.org/ltn/end-of-money.html>The   End of Money and the Struggle for Financial Privacy; Discovery Institute; ISBN:   0963865420.</a> <i>(I do too, mine is <A href = http://emarketplace.techtarget.com/main/0262032716.html>   Trust and Risk in Internet CommerceMIT Press</a>)</i></P><I>Afterwards I asked him what his plan was. I proposed that the Tobin tax be adopted in exchange for tax evasion money laundering, while the drug war is a distinct issue which could be opposed on its own terms. I still don&#146;t know what he thinks about the Tobin tax. I know we are both against the drug war. But money laundering is also used, for example in the trade of women and children, and the slave trade in general example the press release here: </i></FONT><A HREF="http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/ksgpress/ksg_news/publications/trafficking.html"><I><FONT FACE="Times">http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/ksgpress/ksg_news/publications/trafficking.html</font></I></A><I><FONT FACE="Times"> or </font></I><A HREF="http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/stop-traffic/1999/0888.html"><I><FONT FACE="Times">http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/stop-traffic/1999/0888.html</font></I></A><I><FONT FACE="Times"> The drug war issue is tangential to the money laundering issue. </font>On money laundering the issue is: are we willing to give away the rights of the money on the premise that few medium-sized fish will be caught. I agree on the outcome but not on the arguments. </i> <P><b>Provable Secure Implicit Certificates </b>by DRL Brown, R Gallant, SA Vanstone</P><P>Implicit certificates contain a user&#146;s identity, data D, and CA&#146;s public key which together can be used to reconstruct the public key of the user.</P><P>In earlier implementations the CA knows the private key of the user This paper produces a self-certified implicit certificate scheme meaning that user generates private and public keys.</P><P>Uses El-Gamal signature key. The CA and the user contribute to the private key. Verifier can compute the user&#146;s public key using public information ([public data includes an elliptical curve point, user identifier, CA identity, and expiration date, serial #)</P><P>This system has considerable computational savings because the computation of the digital certificate and verification of user (e.g. user proves knowledge of private key) are integrated.  This produces at least a factor of two improvement in processing overhead. </P><P>Next Joan Feigenbaum presented <B>Nonmonotonicity, User Interface, and Risk Assessment in Certificate Revocation, </B>by her graduate student Ninghui Li and herself. </P><P>Revocation is a method of managing risk rather than providing security. Has three recommendations.</P><ol><li> UI of PKI should be clear and simple <li> Difficult of revocation is caused by temporal non-monotonicity <li> A certificate illustrates that the issuer believes a statement at issuer   time t <li> A revocation of a certificate should cancel the certificate and nothing else <li> A certificate that serves diverse applications should have flexible revocation   schemes <li> The UI of a PKI should support auditing <li> We recommend not allowing certificates to be put on hold in order to simplify   auditing </ol>   <P>CRLs proves not that a binding is valid but rather to update the fresh time of all valid certificates</P><P>Stuart Stubblebine (sp?) suggests that he has previously published these axioms in previous FC</P><P><i>Again I think <A href = "#ian">Ian's work</a> would be helpful. </i></P>Next was a paper on <B>Mutual Authentication for Low Power Mobile Devices</B> by Markus Jakobson &amp; David Pointcheval. <P>Mobile apps have strict power and computational limits. Also, mobile users   interact with a range of switches not all of which are trustworthy. Thus mutual   authentication is required.Using Schnorr the computation can take place in pre-processing.   It enables mutual authentication. </P><P>Bob decrypts an El Gamal ciphertext to authenticate himself. Alice who has   low power, uses Schnorr to authenticate herself. For a designated server Alice   can precompute everything. However, it seems to me that the server usually knows   which mobile connection is coming while the client is less aware of handoff   management. </P><P><i>Here are a couple of other paperes on wireless commerce: <A href=www-csl.cs.colorado.edu/csci7000/mobile_papers/peirce99.pdf>   www-csl.cs.colorado.edu/csci7000/mobile_papers/peirce99.pdf</a> and the O project   which I am geogrpahically required to mention [PDF] <A href= info.lcs.mit.edu/data.ws/Research%20Highlights%20rev.%205.pdf>   info.lcs.mit.edu/data.ws/Research%20Highlights%20rev.%205.pdf </a> Notes on   a wireles e-commerce conf which complement this paper are available at<A href=http://www.cs.dal.ca/~akerman/wireless.html>   http://www.cs.dal.ca/~akerman/wireless.html </a></i></P><P>_______________________</P><h2>Rump Session Notes from Tuesday</h2><P><u>The European Bridge-CA Connecting Existing PKIs</u></P><P><FONT FACE="Times"></font><A HREF="mailto:Bernhard.esslinger@db.com"><FONT FACE="Times">Bernhard.esslinger@db.com</FONT></A></P><FONT FACE="Times"> <P>Apps today assume PKI but how do you connect multiple PKIs between businesses/consumers.

They argue that   small changes in the infrastructure would allow much more security.

They are forgeable, although the credit   card space is unexpandable the amount can be changed. Credit card number can   be used multiple times</P><P>The Formal ideal is that one cannot expand space and create card numbers, and   a PIN authenticates</P><P>This would make MOTO transactions still forgeable, at least unexpandable, yet   sill the amount can be changed. As long as one reuse requires PIN, merchant   can replay if merchant sees PIN. </P><P>Credit cards would comply with security definition IF the combination of credit   card number and PIN were long enough and alsways keep secret from merchant</P><P>Thus the proposal for InterCash cards offers a Card id: 9 digits base 32, with   a Card security code: 11 digits base 32 and requires the use of a User PIN:   4-8 chars.

Noting that some of the factual statements   were wrong. For example, Andy Neff said that there was a divide in plumbing   and that was fine. In fact the right was passionately opposed to publicly funded   water systems. Cholera epidemics finally motivated widespread investment in   public water supplies. I accused him of political autism.My point was meant   to be that the distribution of risk is a voting system is deeply social and   political. While those debates about risk distribution should be informed by   technical understanding, making technical decisions about risk distribution   is fundamentally political and social. (My comments were scathing and I meant   them to be far less so. I hate it when I do that. Andy Neff is a committed intelligent   athical person. But still I think the problem of specifications is an (admittedly   irrational) political one, not a strictly scientific one. Having technical expertise   in a democracy can be frustrating because people have the right to be wrong.)</P><P>The discussion was so passionate that it was determined that the other panel   will meet after lunch. </P><P>Q: Do we understand the systems that do exist? Is it that the nature of paper   itself that gives us a false sense of confidence? Can we inspect a system? Do   we understand all modes of failures?

He proposes   this would provide anonymity but certification for voting. </P><P>Andy Neff offers threshold privacy, where the VoteHere system offers threshold   voting.</P><P>I missed the post-lunch session.</P><h2>THURSDAY THE LAST DAY</h2><P>The first paper of the last day began as I was getting my tea, so I do not   know the name of the presenter<b>. Monotone Signatures </b>is by David Naccache,   David Pointcheval, Christophe Tymen</P><P>Predicates are monotone if for any input x if P<SUB>n</SUB>(x)=&gt;P <SUB>n-1</SUB>(x)=&gt;&#133;=&gt;P<SUB>1</SUB>(x)</P><P>Monotone signatures requires a ket generation algorithm, a signing algorithm,   a list n of monotone verifying algorithms. THis offers the following properties:   completeness; soundness (no existential forgery) Indistinguishability missing   public keys should not change distribution of the t+1 certificate</P><P>In most systems the idea is that keys are kept and that revocation is an unusual   event. In this system the possibility/reality of fraud is addressed in the design   by depending on a predicate and key generating function as well as creating   messages such that the verifier can determine on which dates they may be valid   but the attacker cannot. </P><P>Properties of Schnorr: to prevent n corruptions requires n random values to   prevent n corruptions. And clearly this is incredibly expensive. Okamoto-Schnorr   improves on this cost. MSS offers improvements by hidign relationships between   the key generation and signing algorithm. </P><P>Rivest suggests that this is similar to the revealed predicate in MicroMint. </P><P>Shamir says signature size has an upper bound of k. </P><P>A: only verifier and signer need to know k, it is hidden</P><P><b>The Power of RSA Inversion oracles and the security of Chaum&#146;s RSA-Based   Blind Signature Scheme </b>was presented by C. Namprempre (who goes by Miao)</P><P>Critical topics in coin creation: unforgability and anonymity</P><P>RSA is secure but other than noting that it is a one-way function the basis   of RSA security in a transactional system is not well understood. In order to   evaluate digital signature schemes it is important Building on the work of one-more   forgery where forger can get q signatures and is successful is forger can create   q+1 coins, e.g. forger is assumed to have access to the Oracle</P><P>RSA is homomorphic E(a)*E(b) = E(ab) thus coins must be constructed to remove   this homomorphism Chaum&#146;s blind signature were quickly reviewed in her   talk, necessary for most audiences. </P><P>The problem the paper is trying to shop is that the Chosen Target Inversion   Problem is easy to solve without an underlying proof that RSA is np complete.   If Chaum&#146;s signature protocol is forger then the CTI problem is easy to   solve. The CTI problem can be solved in polynomical time. They have proven the   unforgability of Chaum&#146;s scheme. RSA inversion problem such as CTI problems   capture new issues of RSA and are of independent interests. </P><P>No questions.</P><B> <P>Optimistic Fair-Exchange with Transparent Signature Recovery</P></B> <P>Presented by a colleague, neither author could make the conference.</P><P>Transparent means that whatever occurs the participants at the end will have   correct signatures. An example of fairness: airline ticket is provided bit-by-bit   as is payment. </P><P>Trusted Third Party should be used only during set-up and dispute resolution.   TTP can either give affidavit and can be transparent. (recommends work of Asokan).</P><P><i>Non-english exchange with Shamir. For my purposes, an encrypted exchange</i>. </P><P>The transciton is as follows:</P><P>P-&gt; C encrypted item and providers commitment <br>  C-&gt;P client&#146;s committed signature on the item&#146;s description <br>  P-&gt;C item and provider&#146;s final signature on item&#146;s description   <br>  C-&gt;P client&#146;s final signature on the item&#146;s description </P><P>TTP will produce final signatures from the committed signature and will transmit   item to client or payment to provider</P><P>Maintains that this provide a high level of atomicity.</P><P><i>Very similar in goals to the work on NetBill by Sirbu, Tygar, etc. The difference   between them may be in efficiency. NetBill requires one DES and two public key   encryption operations. NetBill requires no operations but read on case of default.   This seems to have traded efficiency for grace in design. However, it is more   efficient than a zero knowledge protocol. Substitutes computation for communication.   Assumes identity of consumer for purposes of dispute resolution. </i></P><P><i>I believe that anonymioty is sacrificed for dispute resolution. However,   the authors were not there so they could not address my concerns. My big thing   in e-commerce was anonymous roolback and asystem which would not allow framing   of consumers even if all security parameters failed.
