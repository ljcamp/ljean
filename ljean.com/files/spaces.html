<p>The Internet has long been identified as an information agora 
(Branscomb, 1994). The role of Internet as a public space for every 
citizen (as opposed to purely for professionals, for example) is being 
shaped by two seemingly contradictory characteristics: Internet is both 
ubiquitous and personal. Cyberspace, unlike the traditional media types 
(broadcast, common carrier, publishing, distribution) and traditional 
public spaces in the physical world (Boston Common, the Logan Airport, 
city library, train station, etc.) enables the citizenry to find new 
ways to interact economically, politically, and socially. This universal 
connectivity of the Internet is its potential for everyone and in 
everywhere. Yet the very nature of its ubiquity may also impinge on a 
variety of individual or organizational rights, thus hindering its 
overall usefulness.
<p>Our goal is twofold. First to help clarify concepts - old and 
emerging, and to bring up important issues involved. Second, to consider 
how regulating the Internet as public space sheds light on public 
policies of the future regarding Internet governance. In particular, 
three issues must be considered when regulating electronic spaces: 
simultaneity, permeability and exclusivity. Simultaneity refers to the 
ability of a person to be two places at once: at work and at a train 
station. Permeability is the ability of barriers between spatial, 
organizational or traditional barriers to be made less powerful or 
effective with the adoption of information technology. The permeability 
of the work/home barrier is most clearly illustrated with telecommuting. 
Exclusivity is the nature of one space, perception, or activity to 
prevent others. Intranets may offer exclusive access through a variety 
of access control mechanisms. In the physical sphere, the walled private 
cities offer an excellent example of exclusivity.
<p>In order to accomplish our goal we begin by describing what the 
Internet is not: a new entrant into the media types paradigm. The media 
types approach fails with respect to the Internet. The failures of the 
media regulatory metaphor have lead to a spatial metaphor, which better 
addresses the subtly and complexity of virtual reality. However, the 
differences which prevent the spatial model from being mapped directly 
onto the Internet are issues of simultaneity and the permeability of 
boundaries on the Internet.
<p>We address the fundamental policy issues that result from treating 
the Internet as public space. We delineate the types of public spaces 
that may be found on the Internet: libraries, clinics or hospitals, 
universities, marketplaces, international marketplaces or cultural 
exchange centers, schools, and as a forum for political speeches or 
debate (?the digital stump?). For each public place a subset of the 
previously discussed policy issues applies in a unique way.
<p>We finally close with the implications with respect to public policy 
which are crucial to the continuing development of the Internet as a 
valuable viable public space. We argue in conclusion that the public 
space metaphor is flexible enough to encompass the equally vast 
Internet, yet sufficiently defined to offer guidance to public policy 
issues, while recognizing that the use of such a metaphor, and therefor 
policies based on the metaphor, is not without difficulties.
<p>The Internet: More than Multi-media
<p>There has been much recent debate about what the Internet really is - 
its role is in society - as it rapidly moves from a pure academic 
interest into the public domain. Of particular interest when it comes to 
characterize the cyberspace is the way we look at the public services 
that are being created with the Internet. Naturally, since the Internet 
is part of the national and global telecommunications infrastructure, 
many tend to classify the Internet?s services into the traditional media 
types. One of the earlier voices in this debate (Camp and Riley, 1996) 
argues, however, that this classification hardly works well.  In fact, 
previous work illustrates, using events at several universities, the 
attempts to fit media types to Internet services have led to incentives 
which neither create protected spaces nor encourage open dialogue. A 
different model, based on treating virtual spaces as their physical 
counterparts, would better serve both the organizations and the 
individuals. (Camp and Riley, 1996) We extend this work by focusing upon 
the Internet's public spaces, and the threats and promises of mapping 
physical spatial models onto virtual space.
<p>Conceptually media types have an advantage in drawing an analogy - 
the classification is based on technological determinism. There are four 
traditional media types: publisher, distributor, broadcast, and common 
carrier. It is easy to distinguish between these media types in daily 
life off the Internet. Once on the Internet, any individual may be all 
four and more: a customer, a merchant, a pamphleteer, a broadcaster, a 
publisher, and a distributor. The media type rubric fails, however, 
because it requires that the Internet be exclusive, technologically 
determinant and that it fit into one of a small set of prescribed 
categories. Physical spaces, though also exclusive, are not 
technologically determinant and are not limited to a tiny set of 
prescribed categories.
<p>To begin consideration, contrast the four media types and the 
Internet. Broadcasters use the commonly owned spectrum to transmit 
content. They do not own the spectrum but instead have a limited right 
to the spectrum based on a license. They initiate all that is sent over 
the airwaves licensed to them. The information they broadcast is 
centrally originated, one to many, and therefore subject to tight 
control -- and stringent liability.
<p>Common carriers are post and phone companies. A common carrier is 
required to transmit all information without discrimination based on 
content. Common carriers are expected to initiate only a trivial amount 
of that which they transmit (e.g., how many phone calls originate with 
AT&T?) and are therefore not liable for the contents of their wires.
<p>Publishers create printed, audio, video, software, or multimedia 
material and transmit it to buyers through distributors. Publishers are 
liable for content, distributors less so. Broadcast is available over 
the air to all, and distribution of primary distribution of physical 
printed matter is easier to control. (Note that secondary distribution 
is an issue with publication as well.)
<p>The Internet, on the other hand, can be all of the media types or 
more and sometimes none of the above in the exclusive sense. It is 
inherently a mechanism for distribution -- it connects networks through 
internetworking protocols and provides reliable distribution with the 
transmission control protocol and the user datagram protocol. These 
technical terms are meaningful in that they describe the basic function 
of the Internet -- to provide transmission and to distribute 
user-generated data. In that way the Internet is a common carrier. Yet 
no one entity owns the Internet, and all who connect can create content. 
If the material distributed on the Internet was low volume the media 
characterization of distributor might work in the legal sense. The days 
of a low volume Internet are long past, however.
<p>On the Internet, everyone can be a publisher. At the same time, the 
method of publication can make the person a broadcaster as well. A Web 
page is a one such publication. Similarly, the CU-CMe connection through 
the Web page is multicasting.
<p>Because the information on the Internet is digital, Internet services 
are not truly common carriage. Digital information is subject to 
analysis with far greater ease than analog information. Firewalls are 
proof that the Internet is not a common carrier; yet both the volume 
which a modern firewall must handle and the imperfections of firewalls 
illustrate that the concept of distributorship is flawed.
<p>There are evolutionary changes in conventional media types that 
preceded the Internet as a new entity. Cellular telephony and cable 
television began the breakdown between the media types with common 
carriage over the airwaves and broadcast over the wire. This was a 
sufficiently small change that the telephony/broadcast models could 
continue with limited legal adjustment. Yet on the Internet this 
separation of media types completely fails.
<p>As an alternative model, physical spaces are not technologically 
deterministic. It seems trivial to say that in architecture function 
does not follow form, yet it is an important distinction between the 
media types model and the spatial model. The Internet is more like 
physical spaces in that the same generic technology defines things, 
which are very different -- different spaces, locales, media or forums. 
It may seem also trivial to note that physical spaces are separated by 
meaningful distance. They are exclusive - you can?t be two places at 
once. Physical space is also synchronous. Thus there is work in going 
from one space to another and time passes linearly during transit. There 
are places that change nature over time. A public venue may have very 
different norms during a Bare Naked Ladies and a graduation ceremony. 
There is again an intrinsic separation -- the passage of time. Similarly 
the media types have appeared distinct to users. Users did not confuse 
buying a cellular phone with becoming Radio Free Arlington, and 
similarly a person knows that there is a change in place because of the 
usual need for travel. Unlike media types, physical spaces have the 
subtleties and shades of gray that exist on the Internet. Distinctions 
can be made in physical space under the rubric of time, space, and 
manner.
<p>The properties of exclusion and determinism make the classification 
of the Internet as a medium tempting but incorrect. The Internet is 
neither exclusively one medium nor technologically determined. The 
concept of the Internet as a space mitigates but does not remove these 
characteristics. A new conception of the private, the public, and the 
personal must be a part of this new rule set. The Internet is also 
unique with respect to public spaces in that it was created in the 
workplace. The public space, the private sector space, and the personal 
spaces merge seamlessly. The next sections focus on these issues.
<p>Digital Characteristics of a Public Space
<p>Strolling in a park, hustling through a train station, or spending a 
quiet afternoon in a city library, each of these activities has a unique 
way of giving us a physical space in the public domain. We claim a place 
in it and enjoy the rights associated with that space. In return, we are 
to adhere to the rules and responsibilities commonly declared in that 
space.  Surfing the Internet as a public domain is a relatively new 
phenomenon, but clearly also needs a similar set of civic rules, 
intuitive or formal, governing its wide-ranging, information-based 
activities. Several concepts about the Internet as a public space come 
to mind when we look at its digital characteristics.
<p>Each of these spaces has implicit, physical definitions of 
permeability or exclusivity. When applying the spatial models the core 
which must be reconsidered is the relationship of one space to others. 
Physical spaces, and some electronic spaces, offer exclusivity. There is 
some parallel on the Internet , with the obvious being the battler over 
domain names -- there can only be one ?sun.com? on the Internet. The 
elements of electronic spaces which are exclusive may have public good 
parameters, as described in (Nissembaum, 1999). In contrast, as further 
explained in (Shapiro, 1998) spaces are becoming more permeable. Home 
and work interact, and there are flows between them. Finally at the far 
end the experience of electronic spaces can be simultaneous -- both on 
the company Intranet and in the public space. How spaces should be 
regulated should consider the case that every space exists across this 
continuum, with the elements of exclusivity, permeability, and 
simultaneity in different dimensions and situations. This is unlike 
physical spaces in that physical spaces all lie on the extreme end of 
the exclusive space. Thus the spatial metaphor is promising but the 
assumptions of exclusivity can be neither completely rejected, nor 
embraced as the only possible condition.
<p>Public and Private. Unlike a physical space in most instances, the 
Internet that connects people, machines and information resources is at 
once public and private. This is perhaps one of the most salient 
characteristics of the Internet - everyone works and lives in the same 
space, shares the same resources with the rest of the community and yet 
each can carve out a part of the space and claim it to be his/her own. 
 From the net we draw in shared resources and tailor them to personal 
use. Conversely, we put proprietary information (personal or business 
web sites, for example) on the net for public use.
<p>Global vs. Local.  An Internet space is by definition globally 
interconnected, but localness provides richness and extends its 
usefulness. Theoretically, it is just as easy to access the web site of 
a museum in Paris as one in Boston or the Smithsonian in Washington, DC. 
Beyond content, however, the Internet also invades the world politics, 
complicating the balance of power structure among nation states and 
globalization.
<p>Trans-lingual and Cross-culture. While English is still the universal 
language of the digital age, the Internet is like the New York City, 
cuddled in ethnic bits. Surfing the net is like walking in the streets 
of New York. Unless you shut your eyes or ears, hardly anything you see 
or hear that is interesting or relevant is rendered only in English.
<p>Connections to the non-public.  An Internet space, even in the public 
domain, may be connected, either inadvertently or by design, to spaces 
that are of a proprietary nature, e.g., workspace, marketplace. For 
example, a proprietary space, a proprietary commercial web site for a 
company (e.g., FedEx), can enhance its business efficiency by making it 
functionally public (every customer using its web site to check the 
status of package delivery effectively becomes an unpaid clerk for 
FedEx).
<p>Control and/vs. Freedom.  This is an external issue of governance. 
Yet the other characteristics of the Internet space described above 
makes it even harder to reach public consensus in this wired time. The 
public wants both unlimited access of information and secure, protected 
electronic environment. The latest evidence of content control and 
related issues is best illustrated in the Digital Millennium Copyright 
Act, passed by the 105th Congress. This alters the balance between what 
is public, what is property and thus what is controlled. For the 
fundamental right of the property owner is to exclude others from its 
use, whether the property is intellectual or physical.
<p>Uses of Internet as Public Space: Opportunities and Barriers
<p>As a public domain, the Internet challenges the average citizen?s 
imagination for its function and power far beyond computing and 
communications. A variety of public uses of the Internet, which draw on 
one or more of the digital characteristics described above, are already 
upon us or emerging. Each of them brings to the fore a set of new 
opportunities, barriers and policy issues.
<p>Digital Libraries
<p>Broadly speaking, a digital library deals with ubiquitous public 
access to digital collections and knowledge. It is open 24 hours a day 
and is accessible where the network is. Not a library by the traditional 
definition, the World Wide Web is the most visible instance of a digital 
library. New ones are coming on-line everyday. At the dawn of the next 
century, every school and home should own a piece of the Library of 
Congress from where ever they might be. This grand vision aside, 
however, there are serious issues concerning the public access of all 
digital materials. Nearly every public library is grappling with the 
problem of how to provide web access and protect the young readers from 
improper digital content at the same time.
<p>The Internet as digital library brings to the fore connections to the 
private, ownership of information, and control.
<p>Content control is the single issue currently debated in terms of 
public interest and value. In both the 105th and 106th Congress Senator 
McCain proposed bills which would require filtering for any library 
which receives federal funds. The  "Children?s Internet Protection Act", 
with the title of section 2 of the bill is more informative, ?No 
universal service for schools or libraries that fail to implement a 
filtering or blocking technology for computers with Internet access.?
<p>There has been similar activity in the states, although one mandatory 
filtering requirement was found to violate the Constitution. In the 
courts a federal judge rejected the mandatory filtering policy of the 
Loudon County, VA library system on the basis that mandatory filtering 
"impermissibly discriminates against protected speech on the basis of 
content and constitutes an unconstitutional prior restraint."
<p>The issue of ownership of information is not one which has been 
discussed with the public interest in mind. The focus on ownership of 
information has intersected with the concept of digital libraries in the 
concern for the continuation of fair use into the digital age. Bills 
which would extend or apply (according to opponents and advocates, 
respectively) copyright into the digital age included the enabling 
legislation for the WIPO treaty, the Digital Millennium Bill, and bills 
to protect compilations of fact, usually called database bills. The 
American library and scientific communities were strongly opposed to the 
WIPO legislation, all database bills thus far presented and certain 
components of the Digital Millennium proposal. The changes to allow 
reverse engineering and cryptographic analysis for engineering, research 
and scientific purposes advocated by scientific societies were made in 
the Digital Millennium Bill, and it is now the Digital Millennium Act. 
WIPO enabling legislation and database bills have been defeated. Thus 
the physical libraries have successfully argued for continuation of fair 
use on the Internet, although there has been resistance to the idea 
among the owners of intellectual property.
<p>Connections between the public and the private are brought forward 
with respect to privacy on the Internet. Forty-one  states and the 
District of Columbia have specific statutes on the confidentiality of 
library circulation records. Library circulation records are records of 
reading patterns. Internet use patterns are also records of reading 
patterns. However, corporate library equivalents, such as Lexis/Nexis, 
are also on the Web. These and similar collections of information have 
been treated as databases and not as libraries. Yet a single uniform, 
technologically agnostic law must treat all these collections of 
information as equal.
<p>Universities
<p>The Internet is changing the landscape of education: Western 
Governors Virtual University makes 500 courses accessible to Internet 
users, community colleges and aspires to serve beyond the local 
communities (Healy, 1998). Harvard?s Extension School is expanding its 
distance education program via the Internet, with course offerings to 
anyone with Web access. On the other hand, many educators argue that 
over-reliance on technologies, such as the Internet, threatens the 
essence of teaching (Banks, 1998). Very few, however, doubt the positive 
aspects of the Internet as a public tool for self-learning and instant 
access to material at minimal cost .
<p>The primary issues of the Internet as a University are issues of 
access and certification. At the University level issues of content 
control versus freedom of access are not crucial. Universities are by 
definition the learning spaces of adults, who are capable of evaluating 
content and taking their own risk.
<p>At the University level cross-cultural issue come to the fore. Should 
text-based translators fulfill their technical potential, information 
availability for those who do not speak English will not be an issue. 
Until and unless that happens making content available in multiple 
languages is of critical importance. Making the Internet "interoperate" 
across cross cultural dwarfs the considerable technical cross-platform 
problem.
<p>Global/local issues are also considerable. Universities are developed 
for use primarily by the citizenry, and are national and regional 
assets. Some universities have responded by closing much of the content 
from all outside the domain. An extreme example of this is Harvard?s 
Business School, which has developed an intranet where students may only 
view those classes for which they are registered. Other universities 
make all course content (within the limits of copyright law) universally 
available. As universities begin to struggle with the abstract questions 
of access policies the spatial model can offer guidance by changing the 
question from ?What is our access policy?? to ?What is our community??.
<p>Of course, the Internet will simplify the proliferation of bogus 
universities and for-profit schools. Thus the issue of certification 
becomes significant.  This is not an issue in the spatial comparison, as 
bricks and mortar are hard to falsify.
<p>Hospitals
<p>A grand example of the revolutionary change caused by the Internet is 
the new online digital Medline, by the National Library of Medicine. 
Other new technological advances in tele-medicine are also being made. 
The Internet will not cure the common cold, but the vast amount of 
medical data available on-line is changing the relationship between 
doctor and patient.
<p>Consider this scenario. There is a historical record of discussion on 
alt.infertility at Deja News, which may reflect that the user posted 
about such things at work. Clearly making a phone call to a doctor or 
musing over one?s medical problems at work is not actionable as an 
employee?s loss of time. Certainly an employee seeking information in 
the library at lunch cannot be acted on by an employer, and the employer 
can not even know the subject of the employee?s search. Obviously 
employers should always retain the right to evaluate performance. 
Employers have an interest in the actions of employers, which are 
identifiable to the employer through domain name. But what of the 
employees interest of privacy? When is the person a patient in the 
doctor?s office and when are they employees at the job?
<p>Cross cultural issues are also important here. Information can be 
tailored to communities with different levels of access. Consider that 
lack of information is a leading cause of preventable death for children 
in the world: that caregivers do not know how to treat fluid losses in 
infants and children greatly increases the risk of fatality. How can 
such information be transmitted appropriately to communities? All the 
issues in the physical space carry over to the virtual one, and ignoring 
these questions by trying to fit the information to the medium rather 
than the many spaces where it may be read will have a predictably 
negative result.
<p>International Marketplaces
<p>Internet Commerce will connect American consumers and small 
businesses to small vendors across the globe. Issues of business 
practice as well as business law will conflict. The most likely early 
adjudicators of business conflict are VISA, Master Card & American 
Express. However, the private sector may not take larger cultural issues 
into account when deciding on clearance and settlements. This may 
engender hostility, widespread friction, and, in the long term, abuse of 
electronic trust.
<p>The answer to the question, ?Where is this transaction?? is not 
necessarily ?on the Internet.? Or, if that is the answer, it will be 
increasingly meaningless. Spatial information can provide trust 
information, and alert consumers and merchants to possible 
misunderstandings as well as something as mundane as shipping costs.
<p>Schools
<p>Beyond the traditional ability to read and write, the skills of the 
digitally literate span a set of new core competencies, including the 
ability to evaluate critically what is found in the cyberspace (Gilster, 
1997). Digital literacy is becoming as important to the next generation 
citizens in the 21st century as a driver?s license to the 16-year olds 
today.
<p>All issues coincide at the school level. The possibility of global 
information will expose children to ideas, thus widening their minds. 
Conversely children can also be exposed to prejudices that narrow their 
minds. As the Internet is global there is no way to remove what is 
hateful prejudice at one place, as it may be reasonable thought in 
another.
<p>The issue of simultaneity occurs at the school. The Internet has very 
tight connections pt public and private spaces. There is no way to get 
the Internet in schools without allowing banner adds. Commercialism is 
school has been consider unreasonable.  Teaching children to be critical 
to commercials is a necessary part of bringing the Internet into school. 
Yet the classroom has traditionally been a place of trust, yet critical 
almost cynical thought is appropriate in the marketplace. Understanding 
that this collision of spaces and norms is occurring is possible with 
the spatial approach but not if the Internet is merely the telephone on 
steroids.
<p>The Digital Stump
<p> Like digital literacy, Web democracy means more than just reading a 
political document off the Internet (Norris, 1999). Educating the public 
(and leaders) to digest unfiltered on-line information and engage in 
political deliberations unrestrained by media control poses a critical 
test of the Internet as a tool of citizenship in a modern democratic 
society. (The recent by Congress of the Independent Counsel?s report 
over the Internet and its subsequent public response seem to be the 
first such test of both the Internet?s technical capability and its 
potential role in the contemporary political process.
<p> What are the possibilities the Internet can create for democracy in 
the 21st century? Is the Internet providing a suitable space for the 
average citizen to more actively participate in public affairs? Or is it 
merely a conduit for hatred and intolerance? While media classifications 
for the Internet are failing with the advent of new communications 
technologies (Krattenmaker and Powe, 1998), exploring issues in civil 
rights in public electronic forums is critical to preserving them (Pool, 
1983). Spatial concepts could make an important contribution here. The 
definition of public spaces and public roles are a critical step in 
re-defining civil liberties and other forms of freedom.
<p>The Marketplace
<p>Economic activities on the Internet will be a kind of universal 
shopping mall, farmer?s market and Wall Street put together - open, 
free, and blending the traditional and the modern. (Camp, 2000). 
Transactions, large or small, will be accessible to all kinds of people 
for both new and old economic activities. Producers study demand from 
data on the Web. Smart consumers on the other hand use the Internet to 
access information about the goods or services before they buy. But can 
they trust the Internet to do business in the cyberspace? To say the 
transaction is in cyberspace is almost meaningless: is it a flea market 
(e.g. ebay), a major mail order company (e.g. L.L. Bean), a start-up 
(e.g. etoys.com), or an established brick and mortar store (e.g. Walden 
Hobbies)?
<p>What are the barriers to economic participation? Again the spatial 
metaphor lends itself to the more complete discussion. For example, all 
auctions at Southerby?s are open to the public. Yet most of the public 
does not attend. What are the range of cultural and economic barriers? 
To answer this question requires a greater understanding of economic 
activity than can be found in CATV and POTS penetration rates.
<p>Implications in Public Policy
<p>Here we discuss how the spatial model would alter perceptions of 
public policy problems in comparison to the media types perspective.
<p>Governance of Internet Use
<p>Issues in Internet governance include security, protection of data 
and intellectual property rights, reliability, trust, standards, and 
global power interdependence (Hurley, Kahin & Varian, 2000; Spar & 
Bussgang, 1996)  Much governance on these fronts has been delayed by the 
perception that what is required are multiple fundamentally new and 
creative frameworks in which to seek answers. By using the already 
established framework of spaces, answers will come more easily.
<p>In security, risk assessments determining the analysis between risk 
and threat will be more widely implemented. The security fallacy of 
security by obscurity appears properly absurd when using the spatial 
model, one does not simply hide valuable assets and call them secure.
<p>Issues of privacy expectation can be more easily delineated with a 
spatial mode than a media model. Those Internet spaces where medical 
information is provided should be defined by the type of information and 
transaction, not by the medium used to transport the information. The 
continuum possible with the spatial concept would provide greater 
flexibility with respect to privacy than the four discrete points on the 
media spectrum. What implications does the concept of Internet public 
spaces have to privacy? Using the Internet spaces metaphor employee have 
a (private) desk drawer as well as a (public) desktop. Further issues of 
privacy in the public sphere could (Nissenbaum, 1999) apply to public 
electronic spaces.
<p>If local governments see themselves as points on the Internet, rather 
than as tangential to the Internet, cooperative governance may be more 
likely.
<p>Understanding that the Internet is a global connected space may yield 
more fruitful talks, as the history of media is a history of national 
assets rather than shared connected space. The history of negotiations 
over common borders and shared resources yields richer and more varied 
models than the international history of media regulation.
<p>Impact on Social Capital and Society Leadership
<p>The Internet enables the formation of ?social capital?, which refers 
to the features of social organization, such as networks, norms and 
trust, that facilitates technology innovation (Fountain, 1998) due to 
increased coordination and interactivity for mutual benefits. On the 
other hand, some (Chapman, 1998) fear that as the new generation of 
political and civic leaders flock to the wealth created from economic 
growth, the society is loosing its leaderships of sensitivity to the 
poor and disadvantaged. Understanding past concerns of spatial 
segregation enables building on a learning from experiments to foster 
equality in physical spaces. The media rubric lends nothing to such 
debates.
<p>Another equally important issue is sociological impact. Heavy 
Internet home users may be vulnerable to social isolation, loneliness, 
and depression, according to a recent study by Carnegie-Mellon 
University (Kraut, et al, 1998. On the other hand, other surveys suggest 
Web users find Internet a positive experience and they use it to build 
on social networks and improve on existing relationships. How do we 
steer the society more in the positive direction with the Internet? The 
spatial concepts create opening for additional research to guide the 
policy debate beyond the traditional bounds of media studies.
<p>Impact on Social Well-being
<p>Many argue that, like at the beginning of Theodore Vail?s era, the 
traditional concept of Universal Access needs a new definition. (Brewer, 
1997) The disputes over what is a ?digital dial-tone? and the definition 
of broadband on the Internet have distracted policy makers from the core 
issues. Beyond cross-subsidy between the haves and the have-nots, urban 
vs. rural, how do we bring the estimated 40 million citizens, with 
various requirements for access due to disability, on line? If the 
Internet consists of various spaces including public spaces, there is a 
Constitutional imperative to ensure access, rather than a simple bargain 
with a turn of the century monopolist. The concept of universal access 
has shown it limitations as the phrase is being twisted so that it has 
so many meanings as to be meaningless. The spatial metaphor will allow 
all the possible options to be addressed without such confusion, e.g. 
access to markets, access to credit, access to public debate, etc.

<p>Conclusions
<p>If a metaphor is to be used to describe the Internet, it must be a 
metaphor as rich as the Internet itself. Yet no metaphor will have the 
same set of boundaries as the Internet or the same issues of
<p>What regulatory construct can protect the interests of the many 
Americans who can access the myriad electronic public spaces only from 
work? What actions properly balance the need for access as citizenry 
with the need of employers for control? Answering these questions 
requires a greater understanding of the characteristics of digital space 
and the resulting implications. Yet answering these questions can be 
assisted by understanding people as moving from one space to another.
<p>The traditional roles of the government at various levels are still 
applicable. However, each has a special twist as the Internet takes the 
center stage. Yet defining these roles in spatial terms creates a better 
conception of the problem. For example the media rubric suggest that it 
is necessary to keep pornography off the wires. Yet the spatial concept 
would argue for a market for content control that is competitive and 
non-exclusionary to ensure that all points of view can be easily 
protected or represented at the desktop
<p>Heading off the negative impacts of Internet on society, requires a 
better understand the social-behavioral issues at the intersection of 
technology and humanity. Supporting the research to gain this understand 
requires the ability to pose the questions in the most full and rich 
language possible. Funding more research focused on human- or 
public-centered technologies requires understanding how technologies can 
be both public-centered and serve economic growth ? just as the town 
square enables debate and supports commerce.
<p>Finally in terms of governance the spatial metaphor will help to 
promote and coordinate work in standards, rules of governance, ethics of 
Internet use. Speech, such as threats, are judged off line by time, 
space and content. The final judgement in the Jake Baker case on the 
threatening implication of his words was finally based on where the 
words were posted. Thus the courts found guidance in a difficult 
situation which balanced free speech and freedom from harm by using an 
implied spatial model.
<p>A regulatory regime that is too extreme may result in employee?s 
limiting employers to private areas on the Internet. This may result in 
a decrease in the legitimate use of public space. The corporate 
investment in the Internet has vastly increased its value by increasing 
the utility through information and service availability. Similarly the 
public square would be of little interest if it did not also house a 
marketplace, and were not surrounded by storefronts as well as 
government buildings. Spatial models offer a subtlety and complexity 
that are lacking in media models.
