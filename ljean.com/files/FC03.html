<p><i>Keynote talk: Digital Cash - ahead of its time or just a bad idea?</i>
<p> Tim Jones (Mondex)
<p>Session Chair: Rebecca Wright. Mondex was an attempt to bring crypto to the 
  masses. Why did it fail? Did it have any successes? What was learned? 
<p>Tim Jones, who choose to introduce himself as Co-inventor of Mondex and therefore 
  the person whose fault it all is. 
<p>This is a business presentation on why bringing crypto to the masses failed 
  even with the support of major corporations. 
<p>"Of all the things we did wrong one was an absolute corker." So he begins with 
  a history of Mondex. Initially the banks choose to create EFTPOS-UK 1986. The 
  banks conceptualized as an electronic check and that led to 250M£ into a architecture 
  based on an flawed intellectual premise. There were huge debates he classifies 
  as jihads on DES v. RSA. "EFTPOS-UK was a turkey so it didn't matter but we 
  learned." 
<p>The UK banks felt debit cards happened _to_ _them_ instead of there being control. 
  The banks wanted to control the next big thing - the charge card, the credit 
  card, and then the debit card using the same architecture. You have high->medium->low 
  transactions so it appears that the next will be ecash. So there was a particular 
  specific search, and then there was a choice for an 'accounted'* model. 
<p>(An accounted model means that the ecash is debited and then loaded on the 
  card. After it is spent it is ends up at the bank again.) 
<p>At the close down meeting the right questions were asked: Why don't we have 
  a business case? Because it is too expensive? Why? Because we have all these 
  accounting steps? why? because we don't know if the data coming in as money 
  is truly money. so let's get rid of all the steps by implementing RSA, ensuring 
  data, and locating liability appropriately 
<p>March 2, 1990 Mondex insight: every purse in a peer-to-peer network is a secured 
  node that removed the need for accounting steps 
<p>What we did right: <li> buckets of market research in multiple countries with 
  quant and qual research <li>sound specification and solid built <li> excellent security 
  model, intellectually clean, independent of components that could be de-listed 
  without breaking the entire system <li> "minimal novelty" approach - do not do 
  anything else new unless you absolutely have to -- too many innovations creates 
  too many unexpected interactions. Money is absolutely the ideal product and 
  improving money is extremely difficult. <li> secrecy to surprise the market to 
  prevent competition a filibuster. 
<p>What we did wrong:
 
<li>we built too sophisticated a product. we were too serious about the whole 
  thing. we should have raced to market with a simple one. 
<li> too close to regulators and they say "hmm it is very serious and therefore 
  must be extremely complicated" this lead to 
<li> "Mature scheme controls"
 in terms of systems and controls Mondex is a mature as VISA and if you think 
  of the relative risks and market size this is a function of having come from 
  a large mature and highly regulated industry
<li>poor marketing strategy. This is the ugly true fact: You Cannot Tolerate 
  a Weak Link in an Innovation Team 
<li> we did not notice the net *because Mondex was a bank, because we had a card, 
  we were not taken seriously. There was quite a lot of "we have pony tails and 
  open toe'd shoes and do real crypto and you are a nasty English banker." So 
  we could not get the attention of the right people. 
  <p>(In my opinion this is a condemnation of the choice to be closed. Not that 
  I amarguing against the existence of the ill-mannered cool-than-thou dot snob 
  thing happening. Yet I was deeply in net commerce early on <thus my book> and 
  Mondex was boring because it was closed. There was nothing interesting about 
  having someone show you a black box and say - trust me this works.) 
  <p>The corker:<b> We Picked the Wrong Kind of Everywhere </b> 
  <p>Town trials are the worst way to do diffusion, because there is an immediate 
  boundary created because it does not work outside. Even in the town it is impossible 
  to get _every_ single merchant to take it. (Naff off? is that some english rude 
  word?) So customers are not sure where it works. When you go and do a town trail 
  because the worst merchants will embrace the system because they are the ones 
  with the worst cash controls and most severe need for Mondex. The least relevant 
  shops with established facilities took it, like upscale locales. Yet the worse 
  places won't take it (like coin-operated laundries). This was also visible in 
  the Upper West Side trial. Town trials are wrong, and the brand becomes associated 
  with failure. You are also trying to talk to every demographic segment. 
<p>redefine everywhere by brand association. (I believe that is what the EFTPOS 
  cards did because they connected with VISA.) By bonding with a known brand then 
  you create a comprehensible customer promise that fits with the way humans extent 
  trust. It also creates a demographic target. It means that instead of getting 
  every single technical challenge right, and making it work in every environment 
  there is a single technical challenge. You can make it work perfectly in a rather 
  narrow rather than work at all everywhere. 
<p>Who is closest to getting this right? Mass transit systems. You can buy the 
  cards in petrol stops (that's a gas station for us). 
  <p>Where is Mondex. Well, you can bet on the net. (ha ha ha). The Dutch were 
    going to use interactive television which is awful. The only product that 
    interactive tv consistently delivers is a screen that says "please wait". 
    Since there are small winnings you can download money from the ban, make the 
    lottery bet, and get your (almost certainly very small winnings) back on the 
    card where you can spend it again. 
  <p>The merchants used UK debit because it was better for them for a check, Koreans 
  are adding it to debit cards. So after two years Mondex will be everywhere. 
<p>No one anticipated pervasive networks. These make server ecash possible. In 
  a networked world where the cost of communications is decreasing even faster 
  than processing power (see the work of Andrew Odzkylo for this). 
<p>M-commerce looks promising. Ring tones and logos are deliverable to Nokia phones. 
  So m-commerce has already go beyond the fantasy no-revenue model of the Internet. 
  There is a picture of my hotel taken this morning. It is just pants. ("Pants" 
  is the english kid rude word. Americans can translate that as "Stink"). The 
  phone is a Vodephone leading edge. (He also has an orange SPV. That is Microsoft's 
  first cell phone. It is a bit like a Handspring Trio. ) 5 million could subscribe 
  to pay a couple of euros for th next hot new single delivered in MP3 the moment 
  it is released. 
<p>Server-based ecash is pants/stink for privacy. IC cards balances the states' 
  right to regulate with the users right to privacy. So Mondex might come later, 
  because society has not been harmed by privacy loss. Only the elites have experience 
  true privacy problems. 
<p>So every card has a Mondex pin. But the card does not need to be linked with 
  an account a person of anything else. The pins are token identifiers. Inside 
  each smart card there is a transaction history file. Any user can set it to 
  a record size. It was initially set to a company standard of 10, and users can 
  wipe this by doing a series of cheap transactions. (I do not buy that argument. 
  I think the user should control records distribution and storage. That's not 
  so hard and allows for ease of dispute resolution. ) 
<p>Contactless has got to happen. People like that flexibility. Contactless makes 
  the product cool. Bankers never think about cool. He proposed a throbbing pellet. 
  If you are into leather who knows what your token might look like. (I propose 
  that a throbbing token is a completely boy idea. Of course I like boys.) 
<p>Security assessment. Public scrutiny is not a sensible way to protect a payment 
  system. On your side of the debate you say that strength requires widespread 
  analysis. Tim advocates controlled access to assessment. 
<p>Paul Kosher (sp?) got inside the product with a brilliant attack with a differential 
  attack. He dismisses the claims of Texas (Sandia National Labs) of having broken 
  Mondex. Basically he says if someone with a facilities of the US government 
  can break it --that is not the threat model. 
<p>He believes publishing security holes is not a good idea. 
<p> Stuart Schechter: Maybe it is not broken because it is not being used. 
<p>TJ: As long as you keep looking and maintain your humility and be honest and 
  humble. (That honesty issue with respect to power and secrets is a chronic problem.) 
<p>Concludes by saying the net has delayed ubiquitous computing but it will come, 
  and we will have to agree to disagree on security mgt. 
  <p>A truly charming talk. An insight on the meaning of ubiquitous. But IMHO 
    he was so totally wrong on the security by obscurity thing. See Matt Blaze's 
    response to his critics on publishing the master key attack. 
  <p>Mike Smith: Well you refuse to believe Sandia. Tim Jones: That Sandia National 
  Labs can break it means that we have a reasonable work factor. What concerns 
  me is the silicon fabs in Eastern China. So my worry is how fast is it that 
  the fabs in China get access to the information. There is a club of good guys 
  working together. 
<p>Nicko: Do you put controls in Mondex that structurally prevent switching value 
  and speed of transaction amounts? 
<p>Tim: There are value, origination, merchant, bank. Bank ones hold large money 
  pots. Origination are bank withdrawal. Merchants are up to tens of thousands. 
  There is a velocity of money control. 
<p>Adam: there are many systems since ecash, yet these have found no traction. 
  Why? 
<p>Tim: Ecash has to be available everywhere. The hurdle to get people to adopt 
  something extra is high. Vodephone and Orange have tried to get people sign 
  up for a stored value account. This is because of the electronic money controls 
  on ecash. Vodeophone and Orange cannot get people to open another account. 
<p>Nicko: Can't you solve that by filling up the everything pot and then having 
  the consumers pay for the telecom. 
<p>Tim: No because a combinationof accounting regulation and the fact that telephone 
  companies are the most desperate and cash-strapped companies. Go in today and 
  offer a telecom company the ability to have their cash be credited weeks later 
  than the monies are credited today. It will be a very short conversation. One 
  way to fix this is to allow the operators to credit the telephony portion to 
  balance sheets at a high frequency. 
<p>RIchard: You are putting much wieght on the prediction that people need privacy. 
  Criminals will be the most attracted. Governments oppose it. Aren't you putting 
  much weight on that guess? 
<p>Tim: Proximity cash with a contactless card is more useful for something which 
  is not always on the net. I do think the privacy argument will play through. 
  The server cash will be there. But you can use the same brand and use both cards 
  and tokens. There will be an increasing number of people interested in privacy. 
<p>Ray: You mentioned the cards as anonymous but there is a purse id. Can you 
  link serial transactions? 
<p>Tm: The purse id follows the token one step. So some effort can create a layer 
  of indirection by using a clean card. 
<p>Q (from someone identifying himself as from Sandia); We have not seen any Mondex 
  cards since the first ones out of curiosity. You said that we were the only 
  people who loaded money onto it. But is that because we were smart enough or 
  because we were interested and curious? 
<p>TIm: We picked the best people we could find and tried to get them to break 
  it. Many people tried to break it. There was a bitalot of noise, and there was 
  interest. Ross Anderson claimed to break it but he never gave us a loaded card 
  or a card id. 
<p>Q (same person): But maybe it is just not yet worth breaking. 
<p>Tim: Mondex does research on the dimensions of attack. 
<p>Paul: So much of your panning about how this might fly invokes the privacy 
  issue, yet your model seems to assume that there is no privacy in the network. 
  If that happens your assumptions go away. But you seem sanguine about this. 
<p>Tim: You are right. I am very sanguine because I am not part of it any more. 
  Agoric Inc has some interesting ideas about peer economics. I think we need 
  something that respects the fact that millions of copies can be sold. 
<p>I argued at lunch that part of the reason Mondex was not cool was that it was 
  closed, and a cool product would have gotten traction. He disagreed. I think 
  it should be included as part of the cost -- that being closed by definition 
  closes things off to you. I also argued that bankers have a risk-averse culture 
  of integrity which is woefully absent in commercial computer programming and 
  that an open system allows people to watch your suppliers. He maintains that 
  they can watch their suppliers very well thank you, and closed deos not imply 
  trust in suppliers. 
  <p> <i><b>Micropayments and E-cash Session Chair: Jacques Stern </b></i> 
  <p> <i>Using Trust Management to Support Transferable Hash-Based Micropayments 
    Simon Foley </i> 
  <p>A quick recap. A payer signs a contract promising to reimburse thru a hash 
  chain. There is a hash chain of length n, issued to a principal payee. The first 
  decision must be made by the payee is "is the payor trustworthy?" 
<p>There is a series a payments. Then the payee seeks payment and the trustor 
  asks if the request for payment is legitimate? 
<p>Using these questions the has based micropayment scheme can be based on some 
  trust calculus. Therefore Blaze & Jane's Keynote system can be applied in a 
  valuable and consistent manner. The rest of the presentation is details of the 
  application. 
<p>We should think of a contract as a certificate that is being issued b the payor 
  that authenticates the payee of having the right to assert demands for payment. 
  Examples given are, trust a payee for up to some threshold. Or for a payor trust 
  any request for payment based on verification of the contract. 
<p>Payee compliance check can check is the payor is authorized to make the first 
  payment. After that the KeyNote verification requires only checking the consistency 
  of the hash chain. 
<p>Richard: Is there a requirement for a pre-existence trust relationship? Why 
  is there a policy question there? 
<p>Simon: Because the trust question is based on the trust of the key. 
<p>Richard F.: So when say trust the party you mean trust the key. 
<p>In delegating hash chain contracts both the validity of the payment and the 
  transfer of the payments must be trusted. How does the party that is receiving 
  the delegated payment confirm that the delegator will not try to both delegate 
  and obtain payment? Keynote can clarify and solve this problem by confirming 
  that the first hash payment is valid and by verifying the contract of the delegator. 
  Thus if the delegator cashed in there would be nonrepudiation when the final 
  payee can prove rights to the payment. 
<p>He applies KeyNote to show how the use of trust calculus and contracts can 
  enable complex subcontract and subcontractors with limits by clarifying the 
  trust dependencies understandable. One cool thing is that the credential in 
  a subcontract then the subcontractor can break the has chain in a different 
  manner (e.g. payee gets p^n, p^8n and can delegate p^4n for a second payment.) 
<p>The need for and details of the contract are clarified by the use of KeyNote. 
  <p> <i>A Micro-Payment Scheme Encouraging Collaboration in Multi-Hop Cellular 
    Networks Markus Jakobsson, Jean-Pierre Hubaux, and Levente Buttyan</i> 
  <p>You have a set of base stations and a set of mobile system moving around. In 
  traditional systems the mobile station would reach the base station in a single 
  hop. In multiple hop networks the base station can be reaching by using routing 
  and sharing in the other mobile stations. CUrrently there are no created networks 
  yet there are many research proposals in such a scheme. 
<p>The major advantage is power. There is an advantage to transmit in multiple 
  hoops, there are lower power requirements. Another advantage is cost as base 
  stations are expensive, or extended capacities for the base station with no 
  increased cost. 
<p>We assume upstream is multihop but downstream is singlehop so this means that 
  the power advantage stays but the cost advantages are decreased. 
<p>Why should mobile nodes forward? Selfish behavior is optimal behavior. Therefore 
  this paper proposes a micro-payment scheme. 
<p>Marti et al proposed a watchdog and path rater which does not discuss misbehavior 
<p>Buchegger looks ar reputation-base collaboration which seems to be subject 
  to pseudo-spoofing 
<p>Rivest looked at aggregation requiring probabilistic payments (using lottery 
  tickets as payments) but this has nor previously been applied to routing 
<p>Micali and Rivest talked about probabalistic payments with deterministic debts. 
  Again very useful but not previously used for routing. 
<p>The general schemes is that the source sends a payment token with the packets. 
  Each node interprets the token as a lottery ticket. If it is a winning ticket 
  you submit the reward claim. In any case you forward the token and the packet. 
  Assume the mobile devices are selfish and the base is honest. 
<p>Attacks: taking only winning tickets sniff packets for other winning tickets 
  crediting a friend (e.g., here send this msg, you'll win with this one) ticket 
  pooling tampering with claims tampering with reward levels, particularly useful 
  with near-source collusion 
<p>Protocol requires a shared symmetric key for each mobile station and a base 
  station. Each mobile device keeps track of immediate neighbors and the distance 
  to the base station in hops. 
<p>Packet dropping a higher receiving neighbor frequency than sending neighbor. 
  Auditing technique in the spirit of fraud for existing telephony networks. No 
  formal model or proofs given. These actions are for future research. 
<p>Adam: What about the digital silk road paper? How does that relate? A: The 
  main difference is that silk road is pure p2p and here we have an operator and 
  take advantage of this. Roger: How can we detect someone who is cheating if 
  there is a model for cheating. What about people framing others for cheating? 
  A: We consider only selfish nodes but not malicious nodes. We consider strictly 
  rational self-optimizing nodes. Paul: It could be beneficial is you could knock 
  out competitiors. A; Not in the general case 
  <p> <i>On the Anonymity of Fair Off-line e-Cash Systems Matthieu Gaud and Jacques 
    Traoré </i> 
  <p>Franel, Tsiounis, Yung improved the security of Solages and Traore 98. Yet 
  in neither case was either anonymity or security propertly proven. In this presentation 
  those works are reviewed . Yet after examination it turns out that both are 
  provable anonymous. Yet neither of these are provably secure because both depend 
  on Chaum's blind signature problem. 
<p> delayed: Retrofitting Fairness on the Original RSA-Based E-Cash Shouhuai Xu 
  and Moti Yung 
<p> moved up: How Much Security is Enough to Stop a Thief? Stuart Schechter and 
  Michael Smith 
<p>Instead of wondering how hard is it in technical terms to break a system think 
  like an economist. Think about, "what it costs to find a vulnerability" and 
  then think about, " What is the value for the adversary to break into a system?" 
<p>In order to make the investigation of this model manageable we parse the paper 
  by modeling the attacker as a thief. If the attacker is motivated by nationalism 
  or ego it is much less feasible to evaluate the willingness to pay. By modeling 
  a thief we can assume the thief only wants attacks that are valued more than 
  they are worth. So a core of this model is the formalization of the outside 
  threat using tools of economics. 
<p>There has been some study about converting access to loot: steal data, sell 
  it access data, encrypt it - resell a person their own data sell access - break 
  into a machine and sell access 
<p>So we can assume thieves are interested in a very high rate of return since 
  they are, by definition, not legitimate business people. So consider the types 
  of thieves. There are serial theft, parallel theft and one-time theives. Well, 
  the economics of stealing are not so different from the economics of honesty. 
  So the greatest concern is the parallel and automated threat. 
<p>Notice the concern is outside theft or social engineering because social engineering 
  or insider theft do nto scale. 
<p>So the approach is to create the expected value for one thief (the one-time 
  thief). Then expand it in time to the serial attack. Noe when you add the second 
  attack you have to consider the possibility that you attack no longer functions. 
  So the probability of detection increases over time and the probability of failure 
  increases over time. while a simple first sketch would show target independence, 
  targets are not independent. Not only is there patching and increased observation 
  but also the attacker learns some marginal amount during each attack. (THis 
  is shown in formal notation.) 
<p>Note that doubling the probability of detection decreases the value of the 
  vulnerability by half. Therefore this illustrates the value of both intrusion 
  detection and the value of patching to decrease the value of a vulnerability. 
<p>Using this model it is possible to make a business case for security. 
<p>It is also the case that anonymity decreases risks to the thief. Increased 
  anonymity decreases risks and non-revokable anonymity significantly reduces 
  the expected cost or risk of being detected for the theif. 
<p>Paul: what does this imply about sharing information? It seems that this model 
  suggest that sharing information does not help the sharer. According to your 
  model there is no risk in sharing. 
<p>Scott: Currently people do not share because of stock market responses. Citibank 
  did just this and their stock price took a hit but they increased overall customer 
  trust. 
<p>Rebecca: It is clearly an oversimplification to suggest that there is no increase 
  in risk. Right now the common oversimplification is that sharing information 
  creates only risk. What you hear now is a debate about responsible disclosure. 
  There is a community of attackers who share information. 
<p>Scott: When you find a vulnerability do you share it with everyone. But what 
  if you have partial information? Most of the value is in victims' combining 
  information to understand complete attacks more quickly. This is an area for 
  further work to make this formal and prove it. 
<p>Drew: What about stock manipulation attacks? 
<p>Scott: Does the market act rationally adjusting stock based on vulnerability 
  information? Large market fluctuations are based on lack of understanding. Understanding 
  should be increased. 
<p>Adam: Criminals like anonymity. They like that but they do it through identity 
  theft and breaking into chains of machines. They avoid formal privacy systems 
  which may be monitored. Does anonymity really help 
<p>Scott: Breaking into a system requires a risk. A chain of servers creates a 
  set of transactional risks. What I am saying is not that anonymity should not 
  be built in but rather than anonymity should be revokable. 
<p>Q: What about liability? 
<p>Scott: I will talk about that tomorrow. 
<p>Rachel G: You talk about sharing partial information, what good is partial 
  information? 
<p>Scott: How much do you want to use this attack against someone who has some 
  clues and can know to watch you? 
<p>Q: What's the use of this model? 
<p>Scott: This model begins when crypto stops. There will always be implementations 
  with millions of lines of code. There will always be integration. This is even 
  being used to price brute force attacks. 
  <p><b>Panel: Does anyone really need MicroPayments? Moderator: Nicko van Someren 
    (nCipher) Participants: Tim Jones (Ex Mondex) Andrew Odlyzko (University of 
    Minnesota.) and Ron Rivest (MIT, PepperCoin), Duncan May (journalist at large) 
    </b> 
  <p>Andrew: Four Fundamental Reasons MicroPayments Will Never Happen 1. a gold 
  dollar Americans go to Europe and say why don't we have a dollar. the Susan 
  B Anthony failed and so the mint came up with a gold dollar. Three Americans 
  have gold dollars. These have disappeared without a trace. Why? New payment 
  schemes take a long time. Coins worked in Europe because the paper money was 
  taken off the market. Credit cards took decades. Internet time is a myth when 
  you are talking about changing the habits of millions of people who already 
  have a good substitute. 2. enabling small transaction Sellers do not want small 
  transactions. Sellers want large transactions. Bundling is common in software, 
  subscription servers, bundling brings in more revenues because of the law of 
  large numbers given the heterogeniety of preferences across the elements of 
  a bundle. 3. Flat rate vs metering Flat rate prices are far preferable If you 
  a producer of zero marginal cost goods you want people to use them and get value. 
  Flat rate gets more customers and more use. 4, price discrimination Going back 
  to the nineteenth century there is a large literature about the value of price 
  discrimination. Price discrimination requires data about use. Greater gains 
  can be achieved by matching user and price -- and anonymous systems prevent 
  price discrimination. 
<p>He has a paper on each one of these points on his web page. www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/ 
  read 'em and weep. 
<p>Ron Rivest Micropayments are for things when the cost of the transaction is 
  so small and 
<p>Micropayments exist as attention span (banner ads) and giving up data for small 
  things. There was 300M $ of paid content on the net. Half of that was annual 
  subscriptions. 14% were single purchase. 6% were some other subscription form. 
  so 14-30% of sales would be single use. Some subscription services have failed. 
  *69 failed as a subscription service, but it works well as 75¢ per use. 
<p>We don't have a choice between subscriptions and pay per use. They work well 
  together. Pay per use may bring in a subscriber. When diffusion is small subscription 
  is not optimal. The killer ap for micropayments is music downloads. The music 
  industry is in trouble. Their prices are too high. Their business model is weak. 
  "Music users prefer pay-per-download to subscription." 60% of American have 
  downloaded music, about 1% have paid. Many who did not pay would be prefer to 
  pay rather than search. There are two parties. The sellers and the buyers. The 
  buyers might prefer pay for download. 
<p>The mobile ring-tone market is also pay for single use. in the NYTimes they 
  are trying to sell music on the web "Echo". Universal sells singles at 99¢ a 
  song. Pay per use will always be available. To support this there is a need 
  to keep transactions processing costs small. A founder of music sites found 
  that credit card companies were charging 35¢ for each 99¢ transaction, By keeping 
  the bank out of the loop it is possible to get substantial processing savings. 
  You can do a rsa verification faster than a disk access. Since we don't have 
  Hettinga to talk about bearer-based systems. I have concerns about these systems 
  so I believe in a database and it is easier to have a per-user database. 
<p>Tim Jones The range of transactions that are currently mediated is large. It 
  is not self evident of why the share of physical money should collapse in favor 
  of non-transactional subscription transactions. Why should the move to the electronic 
  world fundamentally alter the payment choice that has been constant for hundreds 
  of years? 
<p>Those of us in the GSM world are very certain about "SMS was an afterthought 
  in the GSM standard and children took it and created a new language and maybe 
  a new culture." There are some new things that will come along and maybe anticipate. 
  For example my daughter was passed on the M25 and some boys held up their cell 
  phone number. They did SMS and ended up going clubbing that night. 
<p>There are a number of people who are contributing to an open source computing 
  environment which is growing in strength and scale. They are not being paid 
  in an economically sound way. The range of payment options to reflect the value 
  that people in this business world are creating is not adequate. This seems 
  like a case where there are peers who appreciate value, and could assign it. 
  In this case a large value can be created through a very small set of transactions. 
<p>Think of beta wear where there is a free version and a pay version. If the 
  option is to send 50¢ then there is no need to send a free one. That doesn't 
  hurt you but if you think of the millions of desktops then it is incredibly 
  valuable. We are not exploring properly the price elasticity of demand. 
<p>In the word of real life cash there are many small transactions that occur 
  every day. It would be a poorer world if we could not replicate the school bake 
  sale where the purchaser is 7 and merchant 9. 
<p>Duncan The reason I am here is I have followed the track of 28 systems. Some 
  set of them have gone right into the ground. 
<p>Nicko All the schemes seek the James Bond profile - they wanted to rule the 
  world. So they failed the test of the playground and the cardboard box. 
<p>I disagree with Andrew with his concept of flat rate. If you have a flat rate 
  you could pay 10¢ a minute or $100 a month. If I can take an extreme example. 
  The British domestic gas market is de-regulated. Customers used to have an account 
  with British Gas. British Gas sends out 128M bills a year and the customers 
  pay quarterly in arrears. New entrants are coming to the market. The only way 
  they can compete with each other is to compete on the price of transactions. 
  The largest cost is managing the customer account. If one could have networked 
  meter where customers could pay as they go then you could cut out the cost. 
  It could be a compelling economic case. So we don't have to think of the Internet 
  as streaming video and download of video. 
<p>The problem with beans is that the economic model is broken. You have to get 
  the economics right. 
<p>Richard: what can the 10 yr old sell on line for 10¢. 
<p>Tim: The nine year old was a physical transaction. Mondex could have received 
  10¢ for each angel cake. (Is that a cupcake in the UK?) 
<p>Richard: What about intangible goods? 
<p>TIm: I see it in open source. What if you could charge 10¢ instead of open 
  source being free? Right now we have two price points: free and widely high. 
<p>Richard: Were you in the car with your daughter? 
<p>Tim: I was driving a car. A week later I was at a Banker's cruise and I was 
  the keynote and I told the story. And then one of the blokes in the car came 
  up and was the driver? 
<p>Drew: So when I was at security foundations Paul played hookie and we were 
  at Italy and we needed to pay 1000 lira at a tollbooth. They took credit cards. 
  I don't think the Italian government was paying a 25¢ overhead for that. 
<p>Ron: Part of the transactions processing cost is fraud. As technology gets 
  better the space for specialized transactions mechanisms decreases. 
<p>Nicko: Credit card providers charge flat rate plus a percentage because they 
  can. There is a fraud cost for the credit cards. THere is a lower cost for the 
  debit cards. 
<p>Drew: It is highly amusing that CA has a $4 fee for any credit transaction 
  because they don't want to figure out the fee. 
<p>Paul: For the eight year old maybe she could sell her song for 10¢. That is 
  a post-music model. The other thing is to reinforce this that they can live 
  together for cell phones. I have paid per minute every single minute I have 
  used on my cell phone and it works out for me. 
<p>Nicko: In Europe the pay as you talk has passed the value of the subscription 
  base. 
<p>Andrew: Cell phone pricing had flat monthly rate and repaid plans. If you look 
  at usage every day subscriber use is decreasing. We are looking at number of 
  subscribers. So they are going for the marginal person. Users have overwhelmingly 
  shifted to flat rate plan. This has caused a tripling when everyone else in 
  the world is decreasing. The US is the world champion is wireless use per subscriber. 
  per phone revenues are going. 
<p>Tim: But per customer revenue will go down. But that does not mean that the 
  average revenue for customer in the that set if going down. And there is a second 
  major break on usage. And that is price point for pay as you talk is incredibly 
  high compared with any steady state based on cost. This is in part based on 
  transactions processing. 
<p>Jean: Human management. Attention span. 
  <p>Andrew: There is evidence in it from the INDEX experiment (search terms: 
    INDEX bandwidth Berkeley). I argue strongly for this in my paper. Another 
    set of experiment that AT&T did was in the seventies on metered local rates. 
    We did it on a state wide basis. Turned out that 70-80 who would have saved 
    money for the metered rate hated it, because 1) insurance concept to know 
    it is available to use if needed at no more cost 2) overestimate of usage. 
    people overestimate their resources systematically 3) the hassle factor, they 
    just did not want to worry about it for example just understanding it was 
    hard for people. For example, people were played flat rate per call. There 
    are too many choices and too much complexity. That is why flat rate is so 
    good. 
  <p>Ron: If micropayments are going to pay it the ease of use has to be handled 
  very well. Work by Dan Ariely at the Media Lab on micropayments talks about 
  handling this. 
<p>TIm: Jean has hit on a general issue on acceptance. Getting people to load 
  some pot of money is terribly difficult. The prize strategically for those who 
  could get people to do it is enormous. If you could do it you are suddenly in 
  an extroidinary position like PayPal. PayPal got a certain amount of traction. 
  THen Ebay and Citibank all had a go and they all fell by the wayside because 
  there was already an incumbent. So Ebay ended up having to buy PayPal. The first 
  set of corporations that can solve will find themselves starting with a small 
  window. 
<p>Duncan: People will not sign up for multiple payment systems. Only Paypal this 
  morning pulled out. I would expect to see a large number of competing players 
  so there must be very efficient settlement mechanisms so you there must be a 
  very effective market for clearing. 
<p>Richard: Can I make the case that 3% is competitive. Not that they are not 
  making wads of money. It is easiest to ignore is that you have so many players 
  and each of them absorbs some liability for what it does. If you don't have 
  any players you don't have to worry about risk. Then there is the lenders' risk. 
  The deal of the century is the global arbitration fee. WIthout that assurance 
  neither you nor the merchant will give up your half. If a microcredit system 
  is developed so that a million people lose their quarters, then that would be 
  terrible. 
<p>Duncan: There is a 90 day loss period where the arbitrate is huge. 
<p>Adam: Micropayments can come in and be more effective 
<p>Drew: If you have to download some software you lose 90% of your market. But 
  micropayments have that problem. 
<p>Adam: Paypal. 
<p>Tim: Paypal is an extension of VISA to non-traditional merchants. PayPal is 
  a B2B and C2B for non-traditional merchants. But the mobile phone companies 
  have a very effective authorization mechanism. 
<p>Ron: The future of micropayments is in M-space. 
<p>Nicko: What about the great unbanked, people who cannot get credit. 
<p>Ron: I think that is orthogonal. It depends upon how the system is built. 
<p>Tim: Picking up Richard's point that the credit card world is a risk acceptance 
  market. That is an interesting model that has done great things. But if you 
  have a net connected world you can chain the transactions together and have 
  settlement happen as the chain happens. I just offer it to spark thoughts in 
  other folks. Current appliance delivery creates factory to distribution hub, 
  management of hub, inter-hub transport, and hub to consumer. There is nothing 
  in theory to prevent that from being a market that clears step by step instead 
  of competing for the entire chain. 
<p>Andrew: It will come on the back of mass transportation or cell phones. You 
  already have something because it alone has value. It has to be added to one 
  fo those. 
<p>Duncan: You have ot pay 250,000£ to talk to Mondex. We need a system that will 
  start small, 
<p>Ron: I have started a small company. PayPal shows that new mechanisms can work. 
  We will grow the old-fashioned way based on demand. 
<p>Paul: I agree with Andrew's conclusion but not with is inference. I say this 
  as someone who buys rolls of gold dollars at the bank. The point I want to raise 
  that this was supposed to be an illustration of the transitional threshold but 
  that is not the case. But I talk to people in Europe in Canada. They are nostalgic 
  for the era of bills. Bills have a superior interface - it is easier to carry 
  7 bills than 7 
<p>Nicko; The coin pound was accepted not only because ergonomics but because 
  it was called a sovereign. That leveraged nostalgia. It was called a thatcher 
  - it was thick, brassy and thought it was a sovereign.) 
<p>Tim: Kuhnian paradigm shifts take decades. There are problems that ecash can 
  solve like the queues in bars and it is impossible to purchase. He proposes 
  a bar with vending machines where everything is on tap so there is no bar with 
  a single point of failure. I strongly advocate dynamic vending machines so people 
  pay for congestion. Using a smart card you can do a loyalty program and encourage 
  ecash adoption. Yet that is in another mental space. 
<p>Ron: Why is price discrimination impossible with micro payments? 
<p>Andrew: Basically price discrimination is not incompatable with micropayments 
  but it is harder. Most productive price discrimination is based on identity. 
  That is a little harder for micropayments. 
<p>Nicko closes an excellent panel. 
  <p> <i><b>Security, Anonymity, and Privacy Session Chair: Gene Tsudik </b></i> 
  <p> <i>On the Economics of Anonymity Alessandro Acquisti, Roger Dingledine, 
    and Paul Syverson </i>
  <p>Economics is about efficiency. Yet inefficiency is an inherent part of anonymity. 
<p>Anonymity is a complex problem because of traffic issues users who use anonymous 
  systems also provide anonymity ti other users. That is users hide amongst each 
  other thus by getting anonymity you provide anonymity. 
<p>One solution to address this problem is for a large organization (corporation 
  or government) to provide anonymity and require all its users. However, should 
  this be used then any communication that is anonymous nonetheless comes from 
  that organization. 
<p>There are not yet decentralized trust algorithms, 
<p>In economics consumers pay. Yet by its nature users of anonymity both use and 
  provide anonymity. The hordes in coach are better off, privacy wise than the 
  guys in first class. So the guys in first class have ot pay a premium for anonymity. 
<p>Inefficiency costs that propagate back to the user chase users away. Usability 
  is a critical usability suggestion. 
<p>Under what conditions will a system with many players not implode? Public good 
  with free riding. 
<p>Yet in this case free riding is not strictly possible because inherent in the 
  use of the system is providing anonymity to others. Thus those with great interest 
  in anonymity could provide nodes and services. This is promising in that there 
  is broad market support for low overhead services but inadequate support (at 
  this time) for high cost anonymity. There is also the potential for altruistic 
  agents. Public service entities 
<p>Reputation and social capital may provide adequate awards (SETI @ home and 
  remailer statistics). There can be an optimal level of free riding. An open 
  problem is exit node liability. 
<p> q: You were talking about free rides in that anonymous systems were providing 
  free ride. IN p2p networks the sharing of files we can provide anonymous systems. 
  Something like Kazaa could be used to optimize. 
<p>Paul: Once you add the anonymity on top of it. You would have to add it for 
  free. You get it because you are at GA Tech and you just want to do it. So there 
  is free riding for users since it is bootstrapped in. 
<p>Jean: Is the tendency of systems to implode a function of whether Metcalfe's 
  Law applies (each free rider adds increasing value, the nth user adds n+1 value) 
  or if it has decreasing returns so that as n gets large the value of the next 
  ride is ever lower. 
<p>Paul: We currently have existence results. That question could only be answered 
  with analytic simulation. You would have to take a specific system and see how 
  that plays out. 
<p>Julian: Would there be a high correlation between value of anonymity and crime 
  and this is a core problem? Are there legitimate users with high value? Don't 
  you think the value if for the bad guy is a problem? 
<p>Paul: But the bad guys can provide the resources for all the good guys. 
<p>Stuart S: What about the value of concentrated trust in a case like ZKS where 
  transparency allows for trust? 
<p>Paul: You could do the same analysis for several nodes that you can do for 
  one. 
  <p> <i>Squealing Euros: Privacy Protection in RFID-Enabled Banknotes Ari Juels 
    and Ravikanth Pappu </i> 
  <p>Squealing is both a noise made by distressed animals and slang for exposure 
  of private information. 
<p>RFID radio frequency identification. Shows a picture like: : www.aurigintech.com/ 
  smart-ID.gif at www.aurigintech.com/ Smart-ID-Auto.htm 
<p>RFID tags are passive devices that identify themselves usually by simply shouting 
  their identity. They have no battery but obtain temp power from the EMF produced 
  by the reader. 
<p>RFID tags will be the ubiquitous replacement for the bar code. Gillette has 
  ordered half a billion. (This is because in retail drug stores razors are the 
  most frequently stolen item.) Inventory control and failure rates of scans drive 
  this interest. PRADA use described. Here is a PRADA description : www.aurigintech.com/ 
  smart-ID.gif and he discusses the cases from the autoID http://www.autoidcenter.org/main.asp 
<p>Pets from MA shelters now have RFIDs to locate lost kitties (thru a cat scan 
  ha ha). (Ron Rivest's cat, Jack, has one so they call it the Lojack chip.) 
<p>European Central Bank plans to put RFIDs in euro notes. 
<p>Let me repeat that in case all the implications of suddenly non-anonymous cash 
  are not clear: European Central Bank plans to put RFIDs in euro notes. 
<p>Here are some bonus uses: -more efficient mugger (we offer detailed information 
  about our purses) -viruses or attacks based on product choice 
<p>ECB is prototyping advanced systems without public discussions. Then there 
  is security by obscurity. Yet reverse engineering a RFID is fairly trivial. 
  If you encrypt the serial number of the banknote then the encrypted ID becomes 
  the serial number. What about LE access key? Then the tag broadcasts its jurisdiction 
  information. This also requires extremely secure key. 
<p>RFID have little or no processing power so crypto is not an option. What they 
  have is the ability to control read and write access on the basis of static 
  keys. 
<p>Use and El Gamal system with group G of order q. Published generator g. Key 
  generation public key is y, private x. Each note has a signed ciphertext number 
  that can be re-encrypted upon bank use, some number is C=Ey[ID,r] 
<p>One innovative idea in this is to restrict access by requiring physical optical 
  access. So each note would have a printed number that provides access that allows 
  reading. Shops currently have these. Thus illegitimate reprogrammers would have 
  to have visual access. There can still be rogue readers. But using connectivity 
  the supervision can be of the readers, so that each reader confirms that the 
  previous reader has done its job correctly. 
<p>Cloning attacks are still possible but it is more easily detected. Re-encrypted 
  readers can be authenticated and makes tracking easier. 
<p>Solution is not ideal but there is work in progress at RSA labs and in the 
  EU. 
<p>Nicko: A re-writable id is dangerous from from a forgery point of view. Could 
  you now do something that does not require it given that you have hundreds of 
  bits. You could generate many random bits in write-only and have a sequence 
  number in the r/w system. 
<p>Ari: That is a solution we are discussing. 
<p>Adam: This might just be a investment wrt counterfeiting.

  <p>If we have no anonymous cash maybe it's not a problem (that's a joke). 
<p>review of 
<p>Fairness in this framework means revokable anonymity when the user re-spends 
  a coin. 
<p>Fairness has been implemented in discrete log systems using both on-line and 
  off-line trusted third parties. So the question of interest here is it possible 
  to implement fairness using an off-line party and preserving the fundamental 
  RSA scheme. Some systems have used (Chaum Fiat Naro Crypto '88) on which we 
  can build. 
<p>Review CFN 88 and simplify. 1: security parameter H, H1: hash functions 3,

<p>You can view each pair as one-time Lomberg signatures. reveal signatures by

<p> Use El Gamal with two generators to embed user key. TTP obtains user key. 
  Provide that key to a trusted third party. During withdrawal the key of the 
  trusted third party is made available to the bank. Coins can be traced to withdrawal 
  sessions or all coins provided by one user. 
<p>Bank is trusted only not to use customer's money but is not trusted not to 
  abuse customer anonymity. TTP is trusted to revoke customer anonymity but is 
  not trusted with customer's money. 
<p>open research problems include unforgeability because hardness one-more-RSA

  <p><i><b> 11:00 - 12:30 Attacks <br>
    Session Chair: Andrew Odlyzko </b></i> 
  <p> <i>Cryptanalysis of the OTM signature scheme from FC'02 Jacques Stern and 
    Julien Stern </i> 
  <p>Authentication is proof by a user that he knows a secret. A proof may be transferable 
  or not. Assymetric systems require that no secret be exposed for authentication. 
  Symmetric requires secret exposure or sharing for authorization but it is very 
  fast. There is no such thing as symmetric signatures because the secrets must 
  be shared. Symmetric authentication is in some ways superior to asymetric authentication 
  while asymetric signatures are better (by definition) than the (nonexistent) 
  symmetric signatures. 
<p>First example: Access Control Some devices only need to grant access to authorized 
  persons: example a car park reader. Symmetric: device contains all secretes 
  Asymetirc: device need recognize access request secret 
<p>2nd: Access on Payment (toll booth) Symmetric: impossible because non-reputation 
  is required Asymetric: device contains only a public key and users perform costly 
  operations 
<p>What is needed is a pre-processing step where costly message-independent data 
  are generated combined with a low-cost on-the-fly final step. on-line/off-line 
  signatures 
<p>Previous work: schnorr 88: one modular multiplication 92, 96, 99 Girault et 
  al: one regular multiplication 02 Okamoto et al: one modular reduction of a 
  small number 90: Even et al.: one multiplication 01: Shamir: the core operation 
  is one modular reduction of a very small number, extremely efficient and a small 
  signature block produced 
<p>Overview of the GPC protocol. The OTM scheme is a small change in terms of 
  processing power from GPS. The number of messages is very low, except instead 
  of r+e*s send r+e mod s. But the problem is that the reply step will not hold 
  because there are limits on the size of the reply in the GPS protocol. So guess 
  the part of e so that it is sufficiently small. So use the least significant 
  bits of e. Pick a random r. Then compute x= g (truncated e) mod n We receive 
  the challenge and check our guess. Repeat as necessary. 
<p>OTM is not inherently flawed. But the parameters were too small to prevent 
  effective attack. If the parameters size of the key, the number of digits in 
  e, and challenge size are increased then the system becomes secure against guessing 
  attacks. So how does this change the parameters? 
<p>With correct parameters OTM authentication still is 100 bits smaller than GPS 
  However: OTM requires a modular reduction of 320 bits by 160 bits GPS requires 
  a regular multiplication 
<p>This means GPS is twice as fast as OTM. 
<p>dovetailing (r,e) wrt x Add r to a small multiple of s so the least bits or 
  r are equal to e 
<p>If the core operation in OTM is replaced by dovetailing this requires another 
  verification check then this requires three verification operation. Implementation 
  is a simple loop. Using dovetailing with increased OTM parameters the implementation 
  can be as efficient as GPS. 
  <p> <i>"Man in the Middle" Attacks on Bluetooth Dennis Kügler </i> 
  <p>Attacks: unit keys are used for eavesdropping and impersonation (aka cloning) 
  PIN guessing: used for recovering link key Cipher is weak. Privacy: device tracking 
  is possible. 
<p>Add to these the man in the middle attack. These are based on page hopping 
  and channel hopping sequence. This is based on a slave ID and clock setting. 
  So this is a periodic sequence of 32 frequencies. Channel hoping is used for 
  communication. 
<p>Page requests consists of master repeatedly sending slave ID. Slave scans for 
  own id. SLave sends an ID packet in response. Master sends FHS. Slave resends 
  ID. So all the attacker has to do is respond more quickly than the slave, and 
  then reconnect the slave using the same master id but a different offset so 
  the slave and master do not detect each other. If slave and attacker respond 
  at the same time the communications is jammed. Then only the attacker repeats, 
  because only the attacker understands what happened. ANother attack: Since the 
  initiation is a 3 way handshake, the attacker can use the half-open connection 
  to generate a timeout so the slave ceases scanning. (Attacker initiates with 
  slave ID). 
<p>ANother think is master clock is sued for both frequency hopping and cipher 
  initiation. It is possible to inject a Man in the middle during an encrypted 
  communication due to cipher weaknesses and the information in the packet header. 
  <p>Since the same information is used for encryption and decryption it is possible 
    to insert altered packets. 
  <p>Compare this with other attacks. Jakobsson-Wetzel establish a connection to 
  both devices and pretend to be the other device this attack fails if encryption 
  is turned on or one device is non-connectable (because the attacker becomes 
  master and both victims must be slaves). This attack can be expanded using the 
  techniques here to implement an attack when one attack is the master. 
<p>Proposed solutions are end-to-end security => integrating mac in every packet. 
<p>Or wired equivalent security which requires point-to-point security. Even with 
  this the cipher is based on the clock. 
  <p>Inherent in frequency hopping is the ability to create mis-synchronization. 
    Encryption is needed, with full synchronization including frequency synchronization. 
    Unencrypted packet headers with important ACK information are a problem. 
  <p>Nicko: Your conclusion should be if you want to use bluetooth for finance the 
  encryption should be in the application layer 
<p>A; You should use SSL equivalent. 
<p>Nicko: My sell phone has a decent amount of computing power. You should not 
  reply on transport for financial cryptography. 
<p>A; Both are required. And the power limits of the mobile devices must be acknowledged. 
<p> Fault based cryptanalysis of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Johannes 
  Blömer and Jean-Pierre Seifert 
<p>This includes fault attacks and errors, physical fault generation. 
<p>For the AES specifically the time operation is vulnerable. An investigation 
  of an unskilled textbook implementation vulnerable to attack by fault generation. 
<p>Fatal attacks on DEX include breaking a sealed tamper-proof device and putting 
  in wrong ciphertext. 
  <p>To begin an description of what a fair smart card attacker might do to alter 
    and disturb the calculation by altering only the external contacts. An attacker 
    can vary the voltage input and, if it does not cause a card reset. However, 
    the power supply is assumed to suffer from natural spikes. For each card there 
    is a range of parameters that would cause a faulty output that would be, for 
    example, generating an extended pulse that does not spike quickly but rather 
    increases the input some voltage about the specified tolerance but not so 
    high as to reset, say 118% expected voltage. Similarly with the clock can 
    be finely tuned the execution can be altered by causing the CPU to omit instructions. 
  <p>Concentrated optical attacks (for example a focused camera flash) on the right 
  places on a controller it is possible to alter any bit of an EPROM by altering 
  the CMOS path (remember c means complementary) to creating a lower resistance 
  channel on the preferred path. This requires removing the surrounding casing 
  but not physical contact. 
<p>Another attack uses a inductor to read the events occurring inside the smart 
  card. By charging the inductor (also known as an active coil) the reverse can 
  be true -- you can use the coil to cause events inside the chip. He offers a 
  nice table for attacks on smart cards. 
<p>This is all of interest because AES is most commonly implemented on bank smartcards 
  using 8 bit CPUs. 
<p>The speaker illustrates how the general smart card attacks can be used on the 
  most common implementation of AES. For example, using timing attacks critical 
  steps in AES in particular critical XOR operations is that the ciphertext is 
  quite weak. 
<p>The concern is that counteracting fault attack is usually done by some naive 
  countermeasures. Hardware manufacturers should be aware and use: carefully developed 
  logic families, sensors for light and temperature, etc. Only such hardware countermeasures 
  can counteract the source of the attack because once the attack has been made 
  trying to defend against it by calculations is not feasible.

  <p><i><b>Economics of Security Panel Notes 1/28/03 </b></i> 
  <p>Jean Camp, moderator 
  <p>Notes by Rebecca Wright
  <p>Panelists: Drew Dean Andrew Odlyzko Stuart Schechter 
<p>Initial presentations 
<p>Brief intro from Jean: what is security market? 
<p>Andrew Odlyzko 
<p>We are techies, used to formal models. Most people are not as sophisticated, 
  and need simpler explanations and descriptions. 
<p>Example: Honor System Virus This virus works on the honor system. Please forward 
  this message to everyone you know and then delete all the files on your hard 
  disk. Thank you for your cooperation. 
<p>This is a joke to us, but close to something that happens in reality. 
<p>Also, necessary to recognize needs of organizations and people in organizational 
  contexts. Example: a major problem with secure systems is that secretaries could 
  not forge their bosses' signatures. When systems that require this are implemented, 
  bosses share their passwords with their signatures. Similarly, adoption of provably 
  secure time-stamping systems does not work well with intuitive flexible ideas 
  that back-dating is appropriate in some cases. 
<p>Delegation: ask neighbor - please let the plumber in to fix the leaky faucet. 
  Expectations: let the plumber in. If related business occurs, like electrician 
  shows up, can probably let the electrician in. But if electrician and plumber 
  start taking out your furniture, your neighbor would probably call you or the 
  police. A certain amount of human judgment is expected. (This is why you don't 
  ask your neighbor's 6 year old.) 
<p>Intentional ambiguity: proposed SEC rule alternate wordings. 
<p>The desire for human and ambiguousness can limit the adoption of security technologies. 
<p>Example of successful adoption of security technologies: HP9000 After market 
  Rampup (graph). Printer manufacturers make the money on the toner cartridges 
  more than the printers themselves. Competitors can also make compatible toner 
  cartridges. Printer manufacturers have started to put security measures in to 
  prevent/slow other manufacturers. Very quantifiable example. He thinks we'll 
  see more examples like this: manufacturers using very specific solutions to 
  improve answer to specific question. 
<p>Speed bumps on the information superhighway. Cp - criminals will always find 
  a way to make money. Security can be a speed bump to slow them down. (Rather 
  than provably or certifiably secure systems.) Also cp - use of vaccinations, 
  where a small percentage of vaccinations in the population can make a dramatic 
  difference in lowering the spread of a disease. 
<p> Stuart Schechter 
<p>Measuring Security: are we spending enough on security? 
<p>What we don't know: 
<p>How secure is a system? What we're getting for our money What we would get 
  if we spent more What we mean by security, anyway? 
<p>As a result, we spend too much on some systems and too little on others. 
<p>Why measure? 
<p>Determine which systems/components incur the most risk. Build/purchase systems 
  that are more secure. Measure risk (essential to getting better insurance rates) 
<p>The security process: figure. Scope of this talk: measure security 
<p>What is security? 
<p>Process of inhibiting those who would attack your valuables (i.e. make it harder, 
  like the speed bumps Andrew discussed). 
<p>Measuring difficulty: social sciences may be helpful here. Prices can be useful 
  as a measure of difficulty as a cost. How hard is it for a society to make certain 
  things happen? 
<p>The Market Assumption 
<p>A market for vulnerabilities will emerge when one individual finds it easier 
  to find one, the other has more to gain from doing so. If you pay a fixed price 
  to find a flaw, the adversary could do it too. 
<p>The security or robustness of a system against a mode of failure can eb measured 
  economically, in units of dollars. Ie, the market price to find a flaw. 
<p>Security fails in different ways or failure modes - how system failure can 
  be induced, what is lost. Different sites have different requirements as different 
  'valuables' are there with different implications of different kinds of failure. 
  Must measure two products against same mode of failure in order to compare which 
  is better (figure). 
<p>Bounding security 
<p>Placing an upper bound (e..g on competitors system): offer to sell a vulnerability. 
  Offering price is upper bound until vulnerability fixed. 
<p>Placing a lower bound (e.g. on your own system): offer to buy all vulnerabilities 
  offered at a given price. Opportunity cost bounds security. BUT this can be 
  very expensive if the system isn't secure. 
<p>Security experts are regularly asked: which product is more secure? If we can 
  agree on a measure of security, companies may invest in using it. Need to establish 
  trust between buyers and sellers - must actually deliver money in above scenarios. 
<p> Drew Dean 
<p>On the economics of computer security 
<p>Thesis: High assurance, secure systems are luxury goods. 
<p>Look at how they are built: 
<p>Lovingly crafted by hand by Math/CS PhD:s Fewer features than mass market systems 
  Slower to market Extremely expensive Only appeal to a small niche 
<p>These are features of luxury goods, not mass market goods. 
<p>Market-wise, you get trapped in a feedback cycle: 
<p>Assurance isn't a checkbox feature Hard to tell if you have it Difficult to 
  explain to customers Result: little demand, small market, high unit prices 
<p>Options w/formal methods (graph) cost x assurance for different formal methods 
<p>We're now in the lower left hand corner (low cost methods, low assurance results). 
  We don't need to get all the way to the upper right hand corner (high cost methods, 
  high assurance results). But he'd like to see us move to higher assurance, recognizing 
  that higher costs result. 
<p>Current economic climate makes proactive expenditures difficult. Costs of nothing 
  are hard to quantify, so don't get compared to. 
<p>Predictions: nothing happens w/respect to security until a "train wreck" occurs. 
  Intel got serious about formal methods after writing off $467M fo the FDIV bug. 
<p> Discussion 
<p>Q: Andrew, re your printer graph and Stuart's talk - is there something in 
  the graph that could be considered an "upper bound"? A: not sure 
<p>Q: re: lemon market. Computers are not less complex than cars. Can we hope 
  to succeed in removing lemons from computer market as it was removed from new 
  car market (and now only a problem in used car market? A (Stuart): quantification 
  is a requirement to make this happen (analogous to consumer reports). 
<p>Q: luxury markets tend to evolve into necessity markets. Will this happen here? 
  A (Drew): analogy - security market would be like airplane makers needing to 
  know how rivets work at the level of quantum mechanics. Non- composability of 
  security is an issue. 
<p>Q: (to Stuart) question of market for vulnerabilities vs. blackmail. A: need 
  for a trust to develop in the market. When introduced by company (e.g. RSA) 
  can be successful. 
<p>Q: (from Adam Shostak) Most current attacks are using known vulnerabilities. 
  Researchers move on to sexier problems even though solutions to the easier problems 
  are not yet affecting practice. What will happen 5 years out? A (andrew): Not 
  sure buffer overflows will be a problem in 5 years, but also practice will be 
  slow to adopt. They're doing quite well already, thank you very much, and don't 
  really need to pay for your security solutions. Systems are in fact robust, 
  in a different way than we usually mean, but sufficient for their uses. Eg faxing 
  signatures around. We will continue to operate "at the edge of frustration" 
  When things are too complicated, people don't accept them. 
<p>Q: (Jean) Some people do prepare for the worst-case scenarios. Ex - NY new 
  where every school and day care center was in the WTC debris zone and was able 
  to contact them. A: (Andrew). Yes, such things are a part of any infrastructure, 
  and people will overcome certain kinds of competitive instincts and using reserves 
  in response to emergencies. This is part of the human ambiguity we live with. 
<p>A: (Drew, to Adam's question). Buffer overflow attacks took off after publication 
  (when??), known since 60's. Lots of research work in 1990's or so, now tailing 
  off because we have the techniques (even though they aren't much deployed). 
  Drew thinks that buffer overflows will be solved by deployment, but that we'll 
  see race conditions rise to dominance again. 
<p>Q: (Paul Syverson). To Drew: question analogies to airline and automotive industry. 
  E.g. flight controller for 777 was triple redundant and formally verified. Also, 
  in 1930's, car crash implied death. This is where we are now in the computer 
  industry. Role of insurance, govt regulation, consumer pressure in going through 
  this process. 
<p>Q: (unknown speaker, French). Requirements of different agencies are different 
  from each other and differ over time. How can you balance security needs w/needs 
  to reduce costs? Biodiversity will be discussed after its lack causes a failure, 
  but probably not before, as it would require additional resources to deploy. 
  (And even if you get it in there, you have to constantly fight the efficiency 
  guys who will come in to cut unnecessary expenses). A: (Drew) yes, to some degree 
  you're right. Quote - a program which has not been specified can not be incorrect, 
  it can only be surprising. The company must understand its requirements in order 
  to solve them (though of course the process must be iterative to deal with changing 
  environment), No generic answer. A (Stuart) Requirements and security get put 
  to the side because the market doesn't "want a secure product". Need to get 
  product to market dominates discussion. Only would need to put in security if 
  competitors did, which they don't. (Chicken and egg problem?) 
<p>Q: (Rivest) Discussion has been focused on cost to developers of putting in 
  security. What about cost to society of not having it? A (Drew) Good question. 
  Lately the idea of strict liability has beenthrown around. Tragedy of the commons. 
  All of society pays when latest virus goes around, but nobody wants to pay to 
  solve the problem. Eventually something will happen, but doesn't kno when. A 
  (Stuart) society is a general term, which makes this hard to answer. Rational 
  consumers do want to buy something that is better. But, consumers and society 
  don't know how to get to next step. Need an understanding of risk assessment 
  to help consumers understand when one solution is better than another. (Rivest) 
  My running an insecure system can hurt others, not just me. 
<p>Q (Adam) Do you really think consumers are making an irrational decision today, 
  or are they just valuing security less than we do (and realistically assessing 
  the cost of current secure solutions as too high)? A (Stuart) Yes, they are 
  making rational decisions because cost to even assess security is high, as well 
  as those to use potentially more secure nonstandard solutions (which are incompatible 
  with dominant solutions). A (Andrew) Example, complexity of installing patches, 
  when most consumers aren't attacked anyway. They are behaving rationally and 
  selfishly. 
<p>Q (Richard Field) Expand on Ron's point. Understands Drew's point that a catastrophe 
  would be required to make something happen. What are roles of external entities 
  such as insurers, lenders, politicians, end users, regulators, critical infrastructure 
  people, investors, venture capitalists, etc. Will they drive those decisions 
  even though security is hard to measure? A (Drew) Answer to question "which 
  system is better, A or B" is currently that they are both bad. On the other 
  hand, if we could just get rid of buffer overflows and race conditions, we'd 
  be in a substantially improved situation. From research perspective, need incremental 
  solutions but need them to be actually deployed. Without market choices, external 
  factors won't have too much influence. A (Stuart) Seeing it start to happen, 
  e.g. Counterpane and monitoring firms are working out some deals with monitoring 
  and liability rates (more into??) 
<p>Q (Rachel from Harvard): I don't run a Microsoft SQL server and don't know 
  anyone who does. Yet, there was a cost to me and many I knew to not be able 
  to read mail because of an SQL security problem. How can I hope to address a 
  problem outside of my domain, and how does it fit in any model? A (Stuart) Part 
  of the problem is that we expect to be able to use networks for very low flat 
  rate cost, which doesn't give an incentive to the providers to fix things. And 
  adversaries have same cheap access we do. Economic design of systems can have 
  security implications. A (Drew) DDOS zombie attacks are even harder because 
  a longer chain is involved. 
  <p>Q: (Jean) Would the security in software market work if there were a market 
    in security? We have a monopoly in software. Is this the problem? 
  <p>A (Stuart) Contends that Microsoft has more lines of code out there than 
    anyone else. If you could measure security of systems, Microsoft would be 
    at a larger disadvantage because their insecurities would be clear and their 
    cost to improve is higher. Plus they have to constantly build more features 
    and compete, so hard to also add security at the same time. A (Andrew) There 
    is a danger in monoculture, though there are also advantages which they exploited 
    to become a monopoly. What we are seeing know is the interplay between these 
    conflicting concerns. A (Drew) Not clear to me that an absence of a monopoly 
    would change things. Look at subset that is competitive, such as database 
    market - even there, security is not very high of any of the competing products. 
    Would perhaps give more choice to the small number of sophisticated consumers 
    who care. Wouldn't have huge swing otherwise.

  <p> Discusses attacks on mixnets, and pseudonym nets. Described the trust that 
    is committed to the mixnet provider. real anonymity requires that forward 
    and reverse packets be indistinguishable. It requires availability of multiple 
    sources for lists of mixnets. 
  <p>Glen Nuckolls: Efficient multi-source data query Currently users query a single 
  data source to get a query. How does the user know the response is from the 
  server? 
<p>Data provider computes a digest and sends it to untrusted publisher. Query 
  can then be verified. The digest functions as cryptographic checksum. 
<p>Advantages are the untrusted publisher and allows an increase in unreliable 
  communications. 
<p>Implemented with a binary source tree sorted at the leaves so the verification 
  is feasible. Can apply to a general class of structures. Secure assuming collision-free

  <p><i>Benny Pinkas Protocol based key hiding </i> 
  <p>YAKE? - yet another key escrow system this is protocol-based and does not depend 
  on the particular cipher or hash applies to SSL, TLS, SSH2 Interoperable with 
  current implementations and therefore supports incremental introduction. 
<p>Key recovery is done doing hidden channels so it is impossible to filter it. 
  The only way to find it is to examine the source. So it is not a good idea to 
  trust closed source implementations of security protocols. Furthermore only 
  one side needs to run this protocol. 
<p>Applications: governments can add hidden recovery to existing systems. hackers: 
  can patch servers with this and obtain keys Closed source providers: only reverse 
  engineer reveals the attack. 
<p>The attacker changes implementation of client or server. New implementations 
  generates a EAF: encryption recovery key with public key or recovery agency. 
  The data would look like a random nonce to any but the escrow agent. 
<p>Implementation issues: low capacity channels, available fields are shorter. 
<p>SSL example: client randomness (public) server randomness (public) premaster 
  secret (PMS) 46 bytes of secret data RSA is used, PMS is generated by client 
  Client can generate PMS from short seeds embed encryption in client randomness 
<p>SSL 3.0 padding for the block encryption (8 bytes) SSL 3.0 only checks last 
  byte of decrypted pad. so set length to 8 bytes embed EAF in 52 bits of encrypted 
  pad FInd a 12bit suffice st when the entire block is decrypted last byte has 
  correct value 
<p>Implemented, modified ssldump for key recovery.

<p>Digital signatures have their security based on hard computations verifiable

<p>It would be nice to have digital signatures on physical notes. BUt simply applying 
  a digital signature to a note is a problem because you cannot tell it is the

<p>Price discrimination is good economics but bad business: unfairness, re-selling

  <p> <i><b>09:00 - 10:00 Keynote talk: Listening In on the UN: Technology Lessons 
    from the Diplomats Richard Field (U.S. Delegate, UNCITRAL E-Commerce Working 
    Group; Secretary, Am. Bar Assoc. Section of Science & Technology Law)</b></i>. 
  <p>Session Chair: Jean Camp.
  <p> Abstract: Enabling rules on electronic signatures and records, international 
    registry systems and electronic documents of title have all been the topics 
    of recent international negotiation--at the U.N., the Hague Conference, UNIDROIT 
    and other international diplomatic bodies. This talk will look at recent successes, 
    failures and ongoing global harmonization work that have a direct bearing 
    on the development of payment and financial systems. 
  <p>I am here to tell you what the diplomats are thinking. NOt the standards people 
  but the diplomats. WHile you think transferable paper is not money to a diplomat 
  it all the same questions. Ten years ago I sat down with the technology people 
  and it took two years to understand what each other were thinking. Now there 
  is a global UN awareness of what a certificate authority is. When a country 
  comes into the UN there is a heavy cultural 
<p>You need to be aware because the law will drive what you can do. You have to 
  pay attention because the law will shape the market and the market will shape 
  your solutions. 
  <p>Finally you can affect the process that is going on. OUt of the Hague the 
    US pushed something called the judgments convention -- a country must enforce 
    the judgments in other countries. As e-commerce started two consumer people 
    Jamie Love and his spouse have single-handedly stopped that convention in 
    its tracks. Whether you stop something or not you can affect. There are NGO's 
    and people who need expertise. If you have something to say you can say it. 
  <p>What causes an issue to get to the top of the international agenda? It is very 
  expensive it is very slow. Really slow. But the process does lend itself to 
  one thing --problems end up making themselves known. The issues out in the world 
  where some group is having a problem 
<p>The international maritime community has problem with paper and ownership.DOcuments 
  of title were getting there after the goods. The finance people have come. The 
  international votaries are having serious problems. These are trade issues where 
  it is slowing down development. 
  <p>Liability is always a lurking elephant. 
  <p>There were 6,000 references to the MA code alone, the legal formalities, to 
  writing and signatures. 
<p>How can you sell a product and get financed for your risk if there are a thousand 
  laws. Evidence rules vary wildly. What is the value if a signature gets past 
  the front door. The law is trying to leave this to the process of judicial resolution 
  because it is changing so quickly. There is variation, the US approach and the 
  EU approach. 
<p>Harmonization is a tremendous problem. Social passionate issues: gambling, 
  Nazi, explicit sexuality. The general solution is these international trade 
  barriers is not to address consumers, but it is getting harder and harder. 
<p>In e-commerce incorporation by reference requires the ITC was planning to do 
  an eterms repository. Should it be on your own server. Should standard terms 
  be legislated. Standard short form standard of attorney has one line "do my 
  banking" referencing three pages. What about when the reference is in a different 
  language? What is a guarantee on a check? What is a limited endorsement? 
<p>Do you want enabling rules or regulatory rules? 
<p>Enabling lets business do more certain things with predictability reliability. 
  What click-wrap. Contracts have eliminated all fair use and right to criticize 
  a product. Is this is enforceable? This tends to be US vs EU with the EU advocating 
  regulation. 
<p>Limits of contracts will be the major battleground for the next decades. 
<p>Why doesn't technology solve these problems? WHy doesn't Palladium and DRM 
  solve all of these problems? The legal and diplomatic communities do not know 
  how to approach it. 
<p>How has this be approached? 1. get rid of formalities 2. applications relating 
  to formalities 3. build real business applications 
<p>general principles of technology neutrality and party autonomy with a ideal 
  functional equivalence between paper and electronics. THe diplomatic instinct 
  is to avoid two sets of rules. The instinct is to stay technologically neutral 
  and define the old technology as neutral (paper in therefore neutral). 
<p>On paper you have biometrics identification (face to face) tied to the paper 
  contents usually providing integrity. So recipient is liable for fraud. Yet 
  when you are not face to face the liability changes. If you mail check the bank 
  is responsible for authenticating and if the signer were irresponsible then 
  the signer is liable if negligent. So paper rules change. 
<p>Electronic agents, lawyers call them 'automated electronic systems'. Agents 
  can enter into a contract on your behalf. A contract is a meeting of the minds 
  in many countries. So if you download an agent audit makes a contract is that 
  your intent? The diplomatic impulse is "yes". Is that fair? WIll that work in 
  the future? The diplomats need to hear from you if it is right or fair. 
<p>A core desire is you want to recognize if something is foreign. We have seen 
  most of this in UNCITRAL. Basically the global rule is that "Don't say it does 
  not have affect just because it is electronic." This was a radical change. 
<p>The failure so far with this is that there is no global law on authentication, 
  nonrepudiation, and liability. In the US we have Reg E, Reg Z. Why do people 
  use cards in the US? Because the consumer is protected the banks face a strict 
  liability. B2B is different. If there is a commercially agreed upon legal procedure 
  the company is liable. 
  <p>Technological neutrality - Baum and Froomkin set up the PKI group. The rest 
    of the ABA hated it. Therefore everything we have is technically neutral. 
    No state can write a law requiring a PKI. The Europeans love that PKI. 
  <p>Paul: Doesn't the PKI raise constitutional questions 
  <p>Richard: everything the US has done in the past five years has Constitutional 
    implications. This one is on safe ground because of the Commerce Clause. 
  <p>Not to 2, the applications. WHere are they coming from? In 1980s there was 
  a convention on bills of exchange and promisory notes. That was all paper. Should 
  we adjust this for electronic notes. Transferable payment instruments and negotiable 
  payment instruments. The UN also has a convention on the international carriage 
  of goods: sea, roads, ets. What about on-line? 
<p>How do you prove an electronic message represents goods? Well, what kind of 
  goods? 
<p>Tangible goods, intangible, international on-line arbitration. 
<p>The Hague has a law on the international transfer of securities. No longer 
  do people get a certificate. Then it became the fact that GM would record your 
  ownership. Now Merril Lynch hs 1M shares and each customer has 50 shares. The 
  US solved this by declaring a new kind of property. ML goes bankrupt. What do 
  you own? We invented it. All the conference wanted to say was what is it, and 
  where are the goods. We are going to define where it is? So the UN has only 
  decided where it is and that is grossly abused. 
<p>UN has been have been having a new transaction on mobile receivables. THink 
  about where a bank wants to lend you money and take an interest in something 
  of yours. If you do not pay back the loan they get priority over others. How 
  do you set priority? It has to be public knowledge so you file in a jurisdiction. 
  So what about mobile equipment? Aircraft frames and aircraft engines and space 
  ships all have their own regimes. Think about the financing for the aircraft 
  industry - it is huge. SO there is a global electronic registry that places 
  mobile things in a jurisdiction. It will not be in the US or France. The convention 
  does not talk about authentication or nonrepudiation. So they have ignored that 
  issue. The international civil aviation authority owns all the data and they 
  are idemnified but the registry is liable for its own mistakes. 
  <p>OAS is active in the Organization for American States. Negotiable bills of 
    lading for roads but have not gotten on electronic bills of lading. The US 
    and Mexico agree but Canada disagrees. While Brazil follows a more European 
    approach. 
  <p>Goods can be tangible intangible and mixed goods. Money is just a form of intangible 
  goods. Buy a car. And it has software in it and GPS access. The Uniform Electronic 
  Transactions Act says that there is such a thing as a negotiable instrument. 
  IT says it has to be secure. The assumption was that it was an electronic token 
  as opposed to a registry. Now they want it to be a registry. 
  <p>UETA came from the mortgage industry that wants to trade mortgages electronically 
    more effectively.
  <p>States can enact UETA only as it was originally adopted (token based). When 
  there is a registry it will be centralized. Negotiable instruments are converted 
  from physical to electronic. When does one cease to be the item of interest? 
<p>INcentives to improve security - how do you improve the system over time? You 
  shift liability to the party best able to improve it. The Australian have adopted 
  a new EFT. They said if you use PIN security and the user writes the PIN number 
  then the user writes his or her number. This suggests that there will never 
  be a better system because there is no incentive. 
<p>Closing: participate. contact Richard. This talk suggested that next years' 
  papers might include: maritime digital titles transferable and negotiable electronic 
  records (token mortgages) international digital votaries this are some real 
  world problems with specific risks and data characteristics for FC. 
  <p> <b>Fair Exchange Session Chair: Ari Juels </b> 
  <p> <i>Timed Fair Exchange of Standard Signatures Juan Garay and Carl Pomerance 
    </i> 
  <p>Fair exchange is focused on the ability to recover and it is also difficult 
  to do massive parallel. Some of these solutions put a bid burden on the prover, 
  for example requires the prover generate a puzzle 
<p>The goal is to create a bounded computationally system with timing. The contribution 
  of this work is timed fair exchange of standard signatures which admit blinding 
  -new time structure called mirror time-lines -protocol timed for fair exchange 
  of arbitrary values 
<p>There is prior work on time -Cypherpunks mailing list sends material into the 
  future. (May 93) There are time capsules for key escrow so that you get verification 
  at escrow time (Bellare & Goldwaaer 96 97) (Rivest Shamir Wagner) building secure 
  puzzles to hold secrets -computationally intense Boneh& Naor 00) time commitments 
  extension to standard signatures - not for standard signatures authors' previous 
  work include time-released signatures. 
<p>So square a number some (mod N), you can do this is a series so the distance 
  grows exponentially so you can release the information by reversing roots beginning 
  with the greatest distance from the initial variable. Time lines created for 
  g, g^2, ...., g^2^k. You You can create time line values by multiplication by 
  R. 
  <p>So you begin the exchange by committing to a time line-hidden value. Security 
    constraints: binding to value, privacy...... 
  <p>*privacy here is specialized to mean that the data owner can set an initial 
  time and within that computational time the data are hidden 
<p>The creation here is a time line that has first increasing and then decreasing 
  distance. This means a time line can be defined by the initial point, the median, 
  and the end. The initial act is to prove knowledge of the first point.

<p>Some solutions have no automated dispute resolution. Those that do include

  <p> <i><b>Auctions </b></i>
  <p>Session chair: Ari Juels 
  <p> imho: Auctions are of increasing importance in the policy world. Privacy 
    in auctions yields stronger auctions because in public auction design price 
    is often used to signal out-of-band and manipulate the auction. Some solid 
    overviews of the economics of auctions can be found at: Arrow, “The Economics 
    of Agency,” Chapter 2, in Principals and Agents, pp. 37-51. Telecom companies 
    use of open information to communicate in high value spectrum auctions is 
    a chronic and systemic problem for public agencies trying to capture the value 
    of the spectrum for the public. An good place to look at the problems with 
    auction design and what crypto might contribute is at <a href="http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/users/klemperer/papers.htm">http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/users/klemperer/papers.htm</a>l 
    A classic example is the use of least significant digits in a bid to signal 
    to other bids the plans in the next round. You can see this in Mercury in 
    1997. For example are there anonymous descending price repeated round auctions? 
  <p> <i>Fully Private Auctions in a Constant Number of Rounds Felix Brandt </i>
  <p>A fully private repeat round auction. Note that this is implemented using 
    an ElGamal with a public key that all bidders participate in creating. (This 
    would be optimal for governments since all telecom bidders are known well 
    in advance and makes charges against gov't easier to defend against.) By using 
    repeated round the protocol can combine the advantages of an open auction 
    (as bids are exposed and the winner's curse problem is mitigated) and help 
    prevent next-round signaling by removing the identity of the signaler. (For 
    example a BTT signal to fight hard for a particular spectrum segment has true 
    meaning, Bob's Excellent Phone Company does not have the same force.)

  <p> <b>09:00 - 10:30 Panel: Trusted Computing Platforms: The Good, The Bad and 
    The Ugly</b> 
  <p>Moderator: Moti Yung Dirk Kuhnman (HP), Paul Kocher (Cryptography Research), 
    Marc Briceno (independent security researcher) TCPA and Palladium "trusted 
    platform" activities have raised many questions and objections. In this panel, 
    we will confront the proponent and opponents of these ideas and raise more 
    awareness regarding ways of use and abuse of these ideas. 
  <p>The good part is all good. The keys can be protected. The bad is that the corporate 
  alliances e.g. Microsoft and Intel can exert undue control, and kill open source 
<p>Dirk Kuhnman ABout the corporate position and the labs position. The HP corporate 
  is that we will sell whatever Microsoft offers. As to what extent HP has influence 
  as to whatever comes up Palladium, there is little. 
<p>As for the labs which has the technical directorship of the TCPA committee. 
  There is a book on Trusted Computer by HP labs. O am one of the proofreader 
  of this book. Apart from this I have been mostly involved in developing and 
  researching open source software systems. I have helped to kick off the HP lab 
  for secure Linux that was marketed for a year and then taken off the market. 
  <p>1. The unavoidable 
  <p>2. the questionable why is it not always good to be good why trusting yourself 
    may not be good enough why openness is not always trustworthy 3. The avoidable
  <p>3. The Unavoidable IT technology is neither a tool nor a medium but something 
    else. Telephones and mail the medium does not itself alter the messages. Computers 
    on the other hand alter the message. Agents on the computer can obfuscate 
    or modify the actions so that the user's goals are undermined by the active 
    nature of the computer. 
  <p>So how can we create a tool so that the tools does not alter our intents when 
  it transfers our knowledge? AS these machines perform billions of operations 
  per second there is no way the user can supervise the processor. So a hardware 
  platform is required. 
  <p>Dirk's Q why it is not always good to be good? Technically savvy people want 
    to have total control over all the elements of their own computers. Yet when 
    your machine is communicating with others you are always facing a situation 
    where there are implicit agreements with others. There is no cultural framing 
    to communicate the implicit baseline. 
  <p>So when you communicate it is simply necessary that each user give up some 
  freedom to allow the larger network to work. 
<p>2 Q Why trusting yourself is not good enough Here is the hypothesis is that 
  if you are very capable then you should be trusted to be the capable administrator 
  that you are. 
<p>Here you will solve the trustworthiness for your own system. But you cannot 
  communicate the trustworthiness of yourself to others. The system must verify 
  itself. Attaching the trustworthiness to human operators or brands is flawed, 
  it must be attached to a computer. 
  <p>This is not democratic since only the established players will be trusted. 
    So TPCA Is an empowerment technology not a control technology. 
  <p>2Q why openness is not always trustworthy In order to have assurance you have 
  to walk thru the code and have procedures. But if someone could alter the code 
  then it would no longer be trustworthy. Security is orthogonal to licensing. 
  According to GPL you can alter code but altering security code removes it assurance. 
<p>The users who have secure Linux are banks and companies that invest for themselves. 
  And this is not distributed. 
<p>The open source has to have a model that allows sharing and confirms trustworthiness. 
  <<usually we call that a market in the states.>> 
<p>He says big vendors and companies have not stepped in to give assurances. But 
  probably the government wil have to tax and generate secure software. <<this is a very european solution. it will probably be tried in europe contrast to the us approach. an interesting decade.>> 
<p>3. The avoidable There is a virtue in not controlling something is that if 
  a user cannot alter the behavior of his or her computer to be untrustworthy 
  then the user should be trusted by virtue of the users loss of autonomy. 
<p>Much of the discussion of TCPA is about what a major company will build on 
  it - how Microsoft will leverage this to control users. 
<p>If code is law then it must be validated by public discourse. So components 
  that are not controlled must be open source so they can be vetted. Therefore 
  TCPA makes open code much mor important. 
<p>Conclusion Instead of fighting this technology the community should focus on 
  supporting the software and building something on it because openness is a necessary 
  but not sufficient condition for creating a trustworthy TPCA. 
<p>Paul Kocher The company I work for has done work for the RCAA and the EFF. 
  From a business perspective we can see both sides. Whoever will pay use we will 
  work for them. 
<p>What is trustworthy computing: can you build a computer a user can trust? can 
  you build a computer a networked anonymous person can trust? 
<p>We are doing a terrible job of building machines worthy of a user trust because 
  the complexity of a system is continuously increasing. It is no longer possible 
  for a single person to know all things and all bits inside a machine. So even 
  experts can no longer be certain. 
<p>For Disney and RCAA they want to control high value commodity content on the 
  machines of remote users. 
<p>What are intellectual property rights and are they a good thing? AMong technical 
  people the notion of intellectual property rights is one that people meet with 
  hostility. Intellectual property is the ability to dictate your own work. << 
  intellectual property is property and by definition property is the right to 
  exclude others from access. refusing access to words means limiting speech rights. 
  so intellectual property is a passionate debate because it a conflict between 
  the two core American rights: the right to property and the right to speech>> 
<p>Intellectual property owners have a right to remove the autonomy of users so 
  they can be certain about the use of their content. 
  <p>As cryptographers we have failed to developed workable business requirements 
    for intellectual property systems. Practical applied research should solve 
    Hollywood's problems or they will push for additional controls. So we will 
    turn over to Lucky. 
  <p>I would argue that power always increases the desire for control and hollywood is exerting because they can not need to. technology will never offer a static certainty business model change. reality tv has changed video entertainment market. it dynamic industry all  legislative in world change that.
    <P>
  I would argue that power always increases the desire for control and hollywood is exerting because they can not need to. technology will never offer a static certainty business model change. reality tv has changed video entertainment market. it dynamic industry all  legislative in world change that.
  <p> Marc Briceno aka Lucky Green In my statements you will hear quite a bit 
    of intent. Because trusted computing is ensuring your betrayal. 
  <p>I want trusted computing very very badly. I know I cannot trust my computer. 
    I would love to be able to tell what state my computer is in. 
  <p>Let us look at public statements about what the technology is intended to 
    do. TCPA is supposed to make the PC the core of the home entertainment industry. 
    The head of TCPA made five or six comments about how TCPA is absolutely not 
    for DRM. The head of TCPA has said, "There is certain content that owners 
    will not make available on the PC platform. That is unacceptable and we will 
    solve this problem one way or another." This was the second TCPA working group. 
  <p>The business objective of TPCA is DRM first and foremost. AS was said at 
    USENIX security that the contents providers will never see anything over NTSC 
    resolution unless they plug the 'analog hole", meaning make it impossible 
  <p>Micosoft claims it losses millions from illegal copying and Microsoft wants 
    to end that. TCPA will do this. 
  <p>TCPA is about defining the future of the PC. Anyone who would purchase a 
    machine has done so. So how does one grow the market? According to the PC 
    industry the market is saturated. Another market is the home entertainment 
    center. At the center of the home entertainment system can be Sony 5.0 or 
    something Microsoft. Sony sells more consumer electronics than MS have ever 
    sold software. THis market is giant and will be hotly contested. Microsoft 
    believes that TCPA is the only way to win its coming battle with Sony for 
    the heart of the home. 
  <p>THe objective it prevent user autonomy. This enforces three levels of access: 
    1. highest level access you can see everything going on, you can know what 
    is happening and you know the state this is reserved for owners of high value 
    content not users 2. user access 3. minimal access 
  <p>Trustworthy computing now means that third parties can trust the computer 
    to enforce rules in opposition to the desire of the users. 
  <p>Gates: Control of our own documents is much more interesting Levy: You can 
    cause Word to create documents that can only be read for the next week without 
    additional payment 
  <p>Quiz: What does a federal prosecutor call a bit of software that inter-operates 
    with DRM protected file formats? A: A DMCA violation! Meaning five years if 
    you create software that reads DRM protected formats so that creating interoperable 
    technology is a felony. $50,000 per device 
  <p>This will allow the feds MS media player license agreement: Microsoft reserves 
    the right to disable your ability to use other software on your computer. 
  <p>When soliciting members the proposal was to enable secure boot. WIthin the 
    working groups the purpose was to enable DRM to serve the MPAA Later the pitch 
    was to enable DRM for everybody Now TPCA is to eliminate all spam viruses 
    and hacking. Next pending is the architecture if being pitched to Office of 
    Homeland Security. 
  <p>MSFT: Palladium will not be required to read files created prior to the introduction 
    of Palladium. 
  <p>Potential countermeasures To reject TCPA. Demand owner overrride. the security 
    of simple trusted system depends on the owner not having access to the keys. 
    if you do not have access to all the keys then you cannot control your own 
    machines. 
  <p>caveat emptor: if a system tells you that you are loading keys make sure 
    it the use is not flagged to enable enforcement. 
  <p>Kocher: laws are on the books. Philosophical question: do intellectual property 
    owners have the right to provide content for proprietary platforms? Currently 
    several examples, such as cable boxes, copy-protected software, etc. His sense 
    is there's nothing inherently wrong with this. He believes is the functioning 
    of the market. 
  <p>Marc: I made no issues of the IP issues because I do not think they are relevant 
    for the property debate. I know that intellectual property is on people's 
    minds. I do not care if content providers include various restrictions that 
    content owners use. What concerns me is that the content providers through 
    the operating system providers are turning the general purpose machine into 
    a a machine with a platform for a back door that I cannot control or close. 
    I care because TCPA is designed to make computers less secure. 
  <p>Dirk: I was worried about a Palladium discussion. Palladium isn't Palladium 
    anymore. Palladium is not TCPA. There was a point about preventing root access 
    on your machine. This is about preventing root access while engaging in communications 
    with another entity. After this you will have access on your system. This 
    is about contractual agreements in communications situations. Now the good 
    guys don't want to do any harm but they cannot prove they don't want to do 
    any harm. User override will be possible. Conceptually and technically TCPA 
    clearly allows user override. If user override means key access - then lack 
    of user access is very good because loss of user autonomy makes users trustworthy. 
    Migratable keys can come with different security classification. 
  <p>Paul: One comment providing user override with the platform previously known 
    as Palladium, well, there are so many changes you have to change all the architecture 
    and they keyboard and everything else I cannot see how anyone could come up 
    with a such a strong PC. It will not exist. 
  <p>Marc: I would also like to have 20 devices of perfect security devices. TCPA 
    takes root access from a user - if you are root then you determine which instructions 
    your CPU sees and executes. Under the TCPA regime the system cannot work. 
    It requires removal of user autonomy. TCPA is about protecting content from 
    others who believe the information must be protected from you after you purchase 
    it. Paul immediately proposed an override that was an off button. Dirk proposed 
    that you can turn it off if you are not on line and not using any Microsoft 
    software. 
  <p>Moti: Before questions I have something to say about what Paul said: the 
    research community failed to create a DRM solution. No we cannot solve the 
    DRM problem. 
  <p>Drew: To Dirk, I was at the DRM workshop last year. The EU will get the same 
    horrible laws we are. Consumers will refuse to purchase DRM products. They 
    are not serving a market so purchasers will not sell. 
  <p>Paul: I think market driven systems are the way to go. If users don't like 
    it they will avoid it. 
  <p>Ray: TCPA tries to solve the problems of content owner. Can we make the problem 
    of content owners and machine users distinct? 
  <p>Dirk: researchers have tried to come up with the min amount of crypto primitives 
    that allow for a secure boot. If you can find out that a simple mechanism 
    is possible to have monitored boot then let us know. Can we allow for a secure 
    boot without allowing things? Not possible now. 
  <p>Paul: Users want to be able to put information in front of a website and 
    know what the remote computer is what they think. 
  <p>Adam: In regards to Drew's comment about a pocket veto it will be difficult 
    to buy a system which does NOT have TCPA elements built in. I bought this 
    machine so you need to have office to create complex Microsoft documents. 
    I am a technical person and I explored all the available alternatives so my 
    ability to packet veto that I don't want and don't like is not there. 
  <p>Marc: This loops around to the market force in TCPA in Palladium. As HP has 
    said, HP ships whatever Microsoft desires. I asked a senior AMD person if 
    they would support TCPA because Microsoft and Intel decided on the feature 
    so they had to include it. The market force are distorted. Those who work 
    in large MS environments know that they build incompatibilities so that one 
    person's upgrading forces anyone who would communicate to upgrade. The current 
    goal is to mandate the use of this technology by the Federal government. 
  <p>Dirk: It is likely that TCPA systems may be cheaper than others. As for plans 
    to embed TCPA on chip then there would be a requirement to cut off TCPA. It 
    is possible to run Linux on TCPA if it is loaded on the box at the vendor. 
    Getting technology without TCPA in the future may not be possible. As for 
    the comments that TCPA is actually pushed it is only pushed because the original 
    intent of this technology is DRM. IBM sells TCPA computers where losing a 
    laptop does not mean using their data. HP will sell a similar thing. There 
    is a nice business without TCPA. In fact the original intention is to work 
    through the corporate space for road warriors or teleworkers. This market 
    is already there. We are facing groups that are fighting TCPA on political 
    grounds. 
  <p>Drew: I was talking about mass media and office is completely different. 
    Let me remind the panelists of CT by 92. I do not believe in the power of 
    mandates. 
  <p>Julian: TPCA is giving up your rights on your own computer so others can 
    trust you. What do I gain if I give up control? What if something goes wrong? 
    Then it is all my fault. THen if there is a bug who should I blame. 
  <p>Drew: Worse yet if you broadcast viruses to many users are you liable. 
  <p>Paul: We have reached a point regardless - you have no control over your 
    PC anyway. 
  <p>Julian: You decide which applications you run. But you know what applications 
    you run. 
  <p>Paul: An install program is to install whatever you want. Right now consumers 
    have lost power in dictating what goes into technology. People accept the 
    worse material. What is needed is the consumers' union which revolutionized 
    non-technical goods that altered the sale of unsafe products. USers should 
    have products that meet their needs. 
  <p>Dirk: The evolving area of computer security economics is dealing with this 
    question I doubt agencies cannot work because they cannot access the software. 
    They are not able to verify the software. Closed code is not good enough for 
    this community and not good enough for government. It takes along time to 
    understand this and individual consumers cannot do this. I know one thing 
    if we just say we cannot do this then we have given up our control of technology. 
    We should go back to paper. 
  <p> 10:30 - 11:00 Coffee Break 
  <p> <b>11:00 - 12:30 Cryptographic Tools and Primitives Session Chair: Benny 
    Pinkas </b> 
  <p> <i>On The Computation-Storage Trade-offs of Hash Chain Traversal Yaron Sella 
    </i> 
  <p>Nice overview of hash chains and their use in authentication. 
  <p>There are two naive approaches to traverse a hash chain you can store only 
    the root and then compute all others, causing storage of O(1) and computation 
    O(n). A second is to store all the links with computation O(1) and storage 
    (n) Last year there was a FC paper to traverse a hash train so that storage 
    is O(log n) and computation is O(log n). 
  <p>Here the focus is on O(c) computation for some storage trade-off. For example, 
    heavily loaded servers. 
  <p>The hash tree traversal protocol provides with a constant O(M) computation 
    and storage requirements O(kn^1/k) Then starting with the case n=1 then illustrates 
    that length optimality is an interesting and open question wrt this protocol. 
  <p>Yaron starts with a "B partition" and divides the chain in subsections and 
    stores the left-most link of subsection. Then recursively b partition and 
    shows an example. Then shows it so that the root is the base of the first 
    b partition and then the partition creates new trees/subsections. 
  <p>The protocol begins with a b partition. each time a b partition occurs there 
    is a pebble placed in the subsections left neighbor. The pebble induces b 
    partition at its node. A pebble is a dynamic storage element that dies after 
    it is done. Very nice dynamic illustration of the general protocol on a short 
    hash chain. 
  <p>He expands it nicely in double hash chains for the case of two parties committing. 
    The use of simple visual aids is very effective but cannot be reflected in 
    the notes. 
  <p><i> Verifiable Secret Sharing for General Access Structures, with Application 
    to Fully Distributed Proxy Signatures Javier Herranz and Germán Sáez </i> 
  <p>This work is related to secret sharing , threshold protocols and proxy signatures. 
  <p>This protocol allows delegation of signing capabilities from one distributed 
    entity to another. 
  <p>Illustrates some interesting applications and use with three types of delegation: 
    full delegation, proxy-protected delegation and proxy-unprotected delegation. 
    (Fits well with Richard Field's point about the meaning of power of attorney 
    and how we don't know how that might map. This work expands that understanding.) 
  <p>He wants to expand this work to other signature schemes in the future. 
  <p> <i>Non-interactive Zero-Sharing with Applications to Private Distributed 
    Decision Making Aggelos Kiayias and Moti Yung </i> 
  <p>Private distributing decision making is a core problem in cryptography. It 
    requires security, privacy, efficiency and trust. Generic protocols are not 
    efficient especially as the number of participants expands or as the group 
    members change. 
  <p>This work builds on previous e-voting work and proposes applications of PDDM. 
  <p>These applications take more narrowly defined crypto protocols and systems 
    and, with small reconfiguration, apply them to a far larger and arguably more 
    realistic set of general problems.

    An analytic simulation of different anonymous systems. A survey paper on all 
    the micro-payment systems used in transit system. A risk analysis about the 
    change of keys based on the lifetime cycle of money assuming that banks can 
    re-encrypt. (e.g., in Russia dollars are held a very long time as insurance 
    against ruble failure. In the US most dollars go from ATM > consumer >merchant 
    > bank. US solutions would be damaging for Russia.)
