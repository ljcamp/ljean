<br>Introduction to Mathematical Foundations of Cryptography  
<br> Spring<br>
A course that starts with substitution ciphers and ends with elliptic curves. If you learn nothing other than not to write your own, then you have learned the most critical rule of crypto. Crypto means cryptography.

Economics of security and privacy focuses on incentives and behaviors. Only three weeks of cryptocurrency with a focus on its uses in crime, and the privacy (or lack) of its transactions.

    Security</a>

<br> Fall<br>


The literature on which the course is based addresses human, organizational or social questions about security and privacy behaviors of people, groups, firms or even nations. The fundamental pedagogical approach in this class is that of a research seminar, with after an introductory period the class is based on shared learning. Students are expected to come prepared to answer the basic questions.

<br>
Fall<br>
This course was moved to the fall to enable an improved publication window for the students who choose to work on a research paper as opposed to the weekly summaries. Based on previous feedback, the course now begings with an example of security in the world of global power, then it moves to economic definitions, and then to the research papers that are the core of the course. Economics of information security addresses security from organizational, behavioral, and commercial perspectives. The course is based on a series of readings combining classics and cutting-edge work. There are two tracks in the course. One is for weekly essays; the other track requires a research paper. The student may consider both tracks by completing the weekly essays until February 4th, when the topic and abstract for the paper are due.

Organizational Informatics includes theories of organizations and an introduction to analytical tools with emphasis on intuition rather than application.

Social informatics of security requires understanding security as a technology of control, as one element of a larger cultural, social or political reality.

    Security</a><br>
    The language of computer security suggest the range of analogies. A virus 
    is a medical problem, while an invasive worm brings to mind the problems of 
    ecosystems. Computer crime and intrusion detection argue that the problem 
    is one of criminal behavior. Firewalls suggest that the network itself is 
    a hostile force, that must be segregated into the conflagration beyond and 
    the safety within. The construction of demilitarized zones (DMZs) between 
    trusty local area networks and the wider network beyond argues that it is 
    war, not flames, on the network. Yet for all that is involved in computer 
    security, and all that is lost, there is a potential measure: dollars.

    STP 308: Technical Design and Human Values</a><br>
    How are value and political choices designed into technology? How do distinct 
    values emerge from the same technologies? How can policy makers recognize 
    values and prevent hard-wired technological value choices? This class begins 
    with two weeks of theory, but the focus of this class is a series of information 
    technology case studies. 2001-2002 was the first year this course was offered, 
    under the name Design for Values.<br>

    Technology is being presented in popular discourse as a savior from the threats 
    of terrorism, and conversely as threat to democracy with the hard-wiring of 
    big brother. Accountability and anonymity seem to be inherently opposed. The 
    course identifies necessary trade-offs, and illustrates that many of the current 
    security and privacy exchanges risk reducing both. Wireless identifiers on 
    every article of clothing and the Federal Total Information Awareness program 
    are topics in this course as they will be integral parts of our lives in a 
    few years. Framing the class discussion are the basics of choosing security 
    technologies for federal systems.<br>

    and then a series of lectures will focus on specific mechanisms for feedback 
    in the economic and technical realm. Readings and cases will provide real 
    world examples. Dynamic cost-based modeling with technical uncertainty. Technical 
    change presents an interesting set of problems for quantitative modeling. 
    This course was originally offered as &quot;Information and Telecommunications
