I am interested in intersections in the challenges that have risen in the technical and human domians: psychology and security, economics and security, and security and privacy.

<em>SDN</em><br>
Software Defined Networks are the next generation of routing. Yet in SDN development, security is being neglected. Southbound, northbound on the servers that will hosts all the vm switches, all are considered trusted. This is a more recent area for me, the application of organizational and technical trust to SDN.

<br>Security as Risk<br>
<A href= "http://www.ljean.com/files/riskPosted.pdf"><b>Computer Security is Risk Communication</b></a><br>
<em>Want Technically Naive People to Adopt Security Technology? Talk to them in their own terms...<br></em>
Individual security solutions have not been adopted even when individuals have expressed their desire to do so. Our experiment suggests one contributing factor is that the rich array of metaphors used by computer security professionals fail to align with individual's mental models. Speaking of <q>phishing</q>, <q>worms</q>, and <q>infections</q> is not helpful risk communication.

<em>Target for Behavior Change not Education</em>
Is the goal is to ensure that individuals respond appropriately, or to have them exhibit a correct understanding of the mechanics of the risk. If this makes no sense to you, then you probably have some expertise in computer security.<br>

<em><A href=NetTrust/>Net Trust: Defeating Social Engineering</a></em><br>
Description:<em><A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGBKI1QBAr8">The Tech Talk Overview</a></em> describes how Net Trust works. Current trust mechanisms are built for computers, not humans, despite the reams of available research on human trust decisions. In fact, the most common trust devices (e.g., seals, domain names) require the cooperation of the malicious to function. We have developed  a system to use social networks to inform trust decisions. Initial users tests show that Net Trust alters trust behaviors, providing information to people that makes them more trusting of some sites and less trusting of others.

<em><A href="http://www.ljean.com/files/IPv6Policies.pdf">IPv6</a><br></em>
Is the exhaustion of IPv4 an inevitable train wreck? In this paper we generate historical data using whois and compare three policies. The first is prohibition of allocation to those already well-endowed with IPv4. The second is limiting allocations to the minimal allocation that can reasonably expected to be in the routing tables. The third is picking a cut-off date and allocating fractions until that date.

<br>Experimentation<br>
<em>Want Security? Build Privacy.<br></em>
There is some question as to why end users do not adopt security technologies. We argue that this is typical of users to behave as human beings in the domain of risk and uncertainty. That is, there are consistent biases that determine if risks are acceptable or not. Responses to risk are determined more by the perception of benevolence of the creator of the risk than by the magnitude of the risk.
